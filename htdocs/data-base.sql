This article examines the relationship of team behaviors as antecedents to successful team performance and learning during adaptive instruction guided by Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Adaptive instruction is a training or educational experience tailored by artificially-intelligent, computer-based tutors with the goal of optimizing learner outcomes (e.g., knowledge and skill acquisition, performance, enhanced retention, accelerated learning, or transfer of skills from instructional environments to work environments). The core contribution of this research was the identification of behavioral markers associated with the antecedents of team performance and learning thus enabling the development and refinement of teamwork models in ITS architectures. Teamwork focuses on the coordination, cooperation, and communication among individuals to achieve a shared goal. For ITSs to optimally tailor team instruction, tutors must have key insights about both the team and the learners on that team. To aid the modeling of teams, we examined the literature to evaluate the relationship of teamwork behaviors (e.g., communication, cooperation, coordination, cognition, leadership/coaching, and conflict) with team outcomes (learning, performance, satisfaction, and viability) as part of a large-scale meta-analysis of the ITS, team training, and team performance literature. While ITSs have been used infrequently to instruct teams, the goal of this meta-analysis make team tutoring more ubiquitous by: identifying significant relationships between team behaviors and effective performance and learning outcomes; developing instructional guidelines for team tutoring based on these relationships; and applying these team tutoring guidelines to the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an open source architecture for authoring, delivering, managing, and evaluating adaptive instructional tools and methods. In doing this, we have designed a domain-independent framework for the adaptive instruction of teams.'),('10.1007/s40593-017-0151-2','Creating a Team Tutor Using GIFT','Gilbert, Stephen B.','International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education','AbstractWith the movement in education towards collaborative learning, it is becoming more important that learners be able to work together in groups and teams. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have been used successfully to teach individuals, but so far only a few ITSs have been used for the purpose of training teams. This is due to the difficulty of creating such systems. An ITS for teams must be able to assess complex interactions between team members (team skills) as well as the way they interact with the system itself (task skills). Assessing team skills can be difficult because they contain social components such as communication and coordination that are not readily quantifiable. This article addresses these difficulties by developing a framework to guide the authoring process for team tutors. The framework is demonstrated using a case study about a particular team tutor that was developed using a military surveillance scenario for teams of two. The Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) software provided the team tutoring infrastructure for this task. A new software architecture required to support the team tutor is described. This theoretical framework and the lessons learned from its implementation offer conceptual scaffolding for future authors of ITSs.'),('10.1007/s12518-018-0204-8','GeoWebEX: an open-source online system for synchronous collaboration on geographic information','Butt, Muhammad A.','Applied Geomatics','AbstractGeoWebEX is an online system for supporting group collaborations on geographical information such as maps and imageries, and capture and sharing of local/domain knowledge in real time.

Agile methodologies are considered as another alternative process as compared to traditional software engineering practices for developing software products and systems. The focus on emphasizing and integrating people and team factors into the software development process forms a core part of agile development.

Unileverâ€™s CEO, Paul Polman felt strongly that there was no alternative to making sustainability central to the corporate strategy. As the world faces huge challenges, his view was that companies have responsibilities to act, particularly if, like Unilever, they are also doing business in some of the poorest countries in the world. So Unilever set off on a journey that made the company not only look at lifecycle impacts, but also at changing consumer behaviors. But what of the internal organizational behaviors? Companies may have a unique strategy, but if the culture does not provide fertile ground to match that uniqueness, then the strategy will not get traction.

Channeling aid to those who have suffered from a disaster is full of complexities. This chapter explores these complexities, understanding of which can facilitate a quick return to pre-disaster life so that the disaster survivors do not have to depend on relief aid for an extended period. This chapter starts by describing the processes of how disaster aid and emergency supplies flow from a plethora of sources (e.g., private, public, humanitarian, business, and nonprofit organizations, as well as individuals from both affected and non-affected areas/countries) to survivors of major extreme natural events. This chapter also covers other essential and relevant information such as providers and distributors of emergency aid, reasons for making donations, ways to improve humanitarian logistics, as well as the advantages and shortcomings of participation by domestic and foreign military forces in disaster relief operations. Because major relief operations have increasingly been attended by many organizations and personnel, coordination has become a dire problem in the disbursement of disaster relief. Attempts have been made over the last decades to improve coordination and partnership by establishing/developing new entities and assessment tools like Cluster Approach, Good Humanitarian Donorship, and Post-disaster Needs Assessments (PDNA). These topics are presented and the final section of this chapter deals with how social networks facilitate disaster relief efforts.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-77282-0_1','Introduction','Paul, Bimal Kanti','Disaster Relief Aid','AbstractSurvivors of natural and man-made disasters in both developed and developing countries not only need, expect, or receive relief from outside sources to mitigate impacts of extreme events; they also often become proactive within their communities and beyond in terms of building networks and providing assistance to other survivors. Disaster relief represents a response that demands an immediate action to alleviate suffering of survivors and save lives. The primary objective of this introductory chapter is to provide a description of salient features of disaster relief operations conducted across the globe over the past several decades. After introductory comments, the chapter begins with a brief chronicle of the development of major global humanitarian agencies and assistance programs, along with emergence of humanitarianism and volunteerism, which are closely associated with humanitarian assistance. The next section of this chapter summarizes major criticisms of disaster aid provision and also outlines the need for disbursement of assistance to disaster survivors. This is accomplished in part by providing several definitions of natural disasters wherein the need for emergency relief aid for survivors of extreme natural events is either explicit or embedded.

The debt makes it more difficult to understand, maintain, extend, and reuse the artifact. Technical debt could appear in any technical artifact. Currently the debt in source code is in the center of attention. Modeling is an important system development activity. Models can have technical debt and a sign of it is the presence of one or more model smells. This paper introduces a catalog of 46 model smells (https://github.com/erki77/model-smells) that has been created based on a set of code smells. The cataloged smells are general but their examples are given based on system analysis models.

To cope with this challenge, we present a novel framework for software effort estimation, which takes an incremental approach on one hand, using a case-based reasoning (CBR) model, while considering a comprehensive set of different types of requirements models on the other hand, including functional requirements (FRs), non-functional requirements (NFRs), and domain properties (DPs). Concerning the use of CBR, this framework offers a multi-criteria technique for enhancing the accuracy of similarity measures among cases of multiple past projects that are similar to the current software project, towards determining and selecting the most similar one. We have tested our proposed framework on 36 (studentsâ€™) projects and the results are very encouraging, in the sense that the difference between the estimated effort and the actual effort was lower than 10% in most cases.'),('10.1109/HICSS.2007.218','Experiences of Using Pair Programming in an Agile Project','Jari Vanhanen','System Sciences, 2007.

The fact that the team had a limited number of high-end workstations forced it in a positive way to quick deployment and rigorous use of PP. The developers liked PP and learned it easily. Initially, the pairs were not rotated frequently but adopting daily, random rotation improved the situation. Frequent rotation seemed to improve knowledge transfer. The driver/navigator roles were switched seldom, but still the partners communicated actively. The navigator rarely spotted defects during coding, but the released code contained almost no defects. Test-driven development and design in pairs possibly decreased defects.

Some men pursue the even tenor of accustomed ways. Others of greater originality or enterprise live more intensely and often invade the world of imagination. These are the accepted types of research workers, inventors, and advanced development engineers. But Tesla was not found among either of these types of men. He was an example of a still rarer genus-those who consistently live in a land of brilliant concepts, idealized dreams, and aspirations so lofty as to be almost foredoomed. The earlier stages of his career were indeed of a more recognizable and usual type. In 1888 he invented the induction motor. Within a few years later he had devised the specialized high-frequency high-voltage transformer which bears his name. tackled, among many other problems, that of the transmission of power without the use of the usual conductors. For such conductors, Tesla with characteristic audacity dared to plan to use nothing less than our terrestrial globe. He aimed to start at one point on this sphere electrical oscillations of superpotency and by means of them to create standing-wave patterns all over the surface of the earth, withdrawing energy as desired at the antinodes of potential.

Multiphase twin screw machines are traditionally analysed and designed by use of chamber thermodynamic models. However for further improvement of efficiency and reliability it is necessary to use more advanced modelling techniques such as 3D Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). In order to obtain fast and accurate solution of multiphase screw machines using CFD, it is important that a numerical grid of the highest quality is generated quickly and reliably. For that purpose, a deforming grid of a twin screw machine is generated using algebraic transfinite interpolation upon which an elliptic partial differential equations (PDE) of the Poissonâ€™s form are solved numerically to produce smooth final computational mesh.

A television borehole wall imaging system with a light source allowed us to examine the size and shape of fissures intuitively, allowing the top boundary of the HWFFZ to be determined. Per mechanical theory, the overlying strata in the decreasing stress zone was simplified as a clamped rectangular plate and the formula for calculating HWFFZ was obtained by comparing the value of the ultimate deflection of the thin plate and the height of the free space in the lower part of the stratum. In addition, the dynamic development of the HWFFZ was simulated using realistic failure process analysis software. The unusual characteristics of the HWFFZ were analyzed from two aspects: the inapplicability of the traditional empirical formula and the difference of the overlying strata structure of the Jurassic and the Carboniferous Permian coalfields.

The data obtained from 63 Serbian pediatric patients with CA-CDI and from control group of 126 children with community-acquired diarrhea, whose stool specimens were negative for C. difficile and toxins A/B, were mutually compared.

Lethal outcome was noted in two cases, but in children with severe underlying diseases (Crohnâ€™s disease and leukemia).

This paper presents a new method for improving the performance of SAPFs using neutral-point-clamped (NPC) three-level inverters. NPC three-level inverters often suffer excessive voltage fluctuations at the neutral-point of DC-link capacitors, which may damage switching devices and cause additional high harmonic distortion of the output voltage. In order to solve the problem, two compensating schemes are proposed to restrict voltage fluctuation in the inverters. The first is voltage dependent, adopting a voltage compensation method, while the second is current dependent, using a current compensation method. The paper describes the respective circuit architectures and principles of operation. Corresponding models are mathematically formulated and evaluated under typical balanced and unbalanced working load conditions. The results show that both schemes are able to alleviate considerably voltage oscillations and hence harmonic distortions, and the current-compensated NPC inverter outperforms the voltage-compensated NPC inverter. Consequently, it is shown that the proposed approaches are effective and feasible for improving power quality of the grid when connected to nonlinear loads.'),('10.1007/s00773-017-0469-3','Experimental validation of open-frame ROV model for virtual reality simulation and control','Chin, C.

To illustrate our point, we perform a case study on a reuse data set using three different styles of learners: association rule, decision tree induction, and treatment. Software reuse is a topic of avid debate in the professional and academic arena; it has proven that it can be both a blessing and a curse. Although there is much debate over where and when reuse should be instituted into a project, our learners found some procedures which should significantly improve the odds of a reuse program succeeding.'),('10.1109/ASPDAC.2011.5722294','High performance lithographic hotspot detection using hierarchically refined machine learning','Duo Ding','16th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC 2011)','Under real and continuously improving manufacturing conditions, lithography hotspot detection faces several key challenges. First, real hotspots become less but harder to fix at post-layout stages; second, false alarm rate must be kept low to avoid excessive and expensive post-processing hotspot removal; third, full chip physical verification and optimization require fast turn-around time. To address these issues, we propose a high performance lithographic hotspot detection flow with ultra-fast speed and high fidelity. It consists of a novel set of hotspot signature definitions and a hierarchically refined detection flow with powerful machine learning kernels, ANN (artificial neural network) and SVM (support vector machine). We have implemented our algorithm with industry-strength engine under real manufacturing conditions in 45nm process, and showed that it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms in hotspot detection false alarm rate (2.4X to 2300X reduction) and simulation run-time (5X to 237X reduction), meanwhile archiving similar or slightly better hotspot detection accuracies. Such high performance lithographic hotspot detection under real manufacturing conditions is especially suitable for guiding lithography friendly physical design.'),('10.1109/ITSC.2014.6957856','A machine learning approach to vehicle occupancy detection','Beilei Xu','17th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)','To manage ever increasing traffic volume on modern highways, transportation agencies have introduced special managed lanes where only vehicles with a certain occupancy level are allowed. This encourages highway users to ride together, thus, in theory, more efficiently transporting people through the highway system. In order to be effective, however, adherence to the vehicle occupancy rules has to be enforced. Recent studies have shown that the traditional approach of dispatching traffic law enforcement officers to perform roadside visual inspections is not only expensive and dangerous, but also ineffective for managed lane enforcement. In this paper, we describe an image-based machine learning approach for automatic or semi-automatic vehicle occupancy detection. Our method localizes windshield regions by constructing an elastic deformation model from sets of uniquely defined landmark points along the front windshield. From the localized windshield region, the method calculates image-level feature representations, which are then applied to a trained classifier for classifying the vehicle into violator and non-violator classes.'),('10.1109/ICVD.2005.137','Placement and routing for 3D-FPGAs using reinforcement learning and support vector machines','R. Manimegalai','18th International Conference on VLSI Design held jointly with 4th International Conference on Embedded Systems Design','The primary advantage of using 3D-FPGA over 2D-FPGA is that the vertical stacking of active layers reduce the Manhattan distance between the components in 3D-FPGA than when placed on 2D-FPGA. This results in a considerable reduction in total interconnect length. Reduced wire length eventually leads to reduction in delay and hence improved performance and speed. Design of an efficient placement and routing algorithm for 3D-FPGA that fully exploits the above mentioned advantage is a problem of deep research and commercial interest. In this paper, an efficient placement and routing algorithm is proposed for 3D-FPGAs which yields better results in terms of total interconnect length and channel-width. The proposed algorithm employs two important techniques, namely, reinforcement learning (RL) and support vector machines (SVMs), to perform the placement. The proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on standard benchmark circuits and the results obtained are encouraging. This is one of the very few instances where reinforcement learning is used for solving a problem in the area of VLSI.'),('','','','',''),('10.1007/978-94-007-6165-0_91-1','Ausubelian Theory of Learning','Novak, Joseph D.','Encyclopedia of Science Education',''),('10.1007/978-94-007-6165-0_116-2','Language and Learning Science','Bielenia-Grajewska, Magdalena','Encyclopedia of Science Education',''),('10.1007/978-3-319-01904-8_21-1','Analysis of Home Health Sensor Data','KrÃ¶se, Ben','Handbook of Smart Homes, Health Care and Well-Being','AbstractThis chapter focuses on the analysis of data that is collected from sensors in the home environment.

In those conflicts, the military forces increasingly found themselves operating among the people. The emerging need in military interventions to prevent casualties translated into a range of value-driven military technological developments, such as military robots and nonlethal weapons (NLW). NLWs are characterized by a certain technological and operational design â€œwindowâ€ of permissible physiological effect, defined at each end by values: one value is a controlled physiological impact to enforce compliance by targeted individuals and the other value is the prevention of inflicting serious harm of fatality. Robot drones, mine detectors, and sensing devices are employed on the battlefield but are operated at a safe distance by humans. Their deployment serves to decrease casualties and traumatic stress among own military personnel and seeks to enhance efficiency and tactical and operational superiority.This chapter points out that societal and political implications of designing for values in the military domain are governed by a fundamentally different scheme than is the case in the civil domain.

In the last two decades, a community has been formed that addresses issues in argumentation theory focusing on methods and problems as studied in artificial intelligence. Much of this work is formal or computational in nature, but often has a relevance that goes beyond artificial intelligence per se. This chapter is an attempt to show this relevance to a wider audience by focusing on key ideas and themes and less on formal and computational detail. The chapter starts with historic roots of the treatment of argumentation in artificial intelligence, by discussing non-monotonic logic, in particular Raymond Reiterâ€™s logic of default reasoning and logic programming, and defeasible reasoning, where especially John Pollockâ€™s multifaceted treatment of argument defeat has shaped how argumentation is handled in artificial intelligence. The chapter continues with what is known in the field as abstract argumentation. In abstract argumentation, the focus of study is on attack between arguments, as an abstract formal relation, an approach proposed and developed by Phan Minh Dung. This approach has become very influential, but by its formal mathematical nature can prove daunting. Many key ideas can be explained in elementary terms, which is what we have aimed to do in Sect. 11.4. Then follows a discussion of artificial intelligence research into argument structure, with treatments of the role of argument specificity, conclusive force, the relation with classical logic, and the combination of support and attack. Next we treat argument schemes and argumentation dialogues, two areas of study where there is an especially strong cross-fertilization between argumentation theory and artificial intelligence. In part this can be explained by the study of argumentation by AI researchers focusing on the field of law and by the rise of the multi-agent systems perspective in computer science and artificial intelligence. Specific themes reviewed in the chapter are reasoning with rules and with cases, the role of the audience and values, argumentation support software, burden of proof and evidence, and argument strength. All in all we hope that the chapter helps to enhance the collaboration between artificial intelligence and argumentation theory.'),('10.1007/978-94-007-6165-0_392-1','Tangible and Embodied Interactions for Learning','Slotta, James','Encyclopedia of Science Education',''),('10.1007/978-94-007-6165-0_131-1','Role-Plays and Drama in Science Learning','Smith, Caroline','Encyclopedia of Science Education',''),('10.1007/978-3-642-40458-0_26-1','Innovation in Historical Perspective','Engerman, Stanley L.','Handbook of Cliometrics',''),('10.1007/978-94-007-6165-0_327-2','Science Exhibits','Nursall, Alan','Encyclopedia of Science Education',''),('10.1007/978-3-642-40458-0_26-2','Innovation in Historical Perspective','Engerman, Stanley L.','Handbook of Cliometrics','AbstractIt is necessary to study the historical record concerning the economic nature of technological change, the constraints it confronts, and the complementarities with other sectors of the economy in order to fully understand the nature of innovation.

In Sect. 3.2, it is shown that there are great differences between the way logicians approach reasoning and argument and the interests of argumentation theorists. Because some developments in logic form nevertheless part of the background of argumentation theory, the discussion of logic in Chap. 2 is in Sect. 3.3 continued with a focus on the crucial concept of â€œvalidity.â€ A number of formal and nonformal concepts of validity are presented.As regards the developments in fallacy theory since Aristotle, special attention is given in to in Section 3.4 the addition of the so-called â€œad fallaciesâ€ â€“ a category of arguments introduced by John Locke. Ultimately, the developments that have taken place have resulted in what Hamblin (Fallacies. London: Methuen, 1970) called â€œthe standard treatment.â€ Sections 3.5 and 3.6 are devoted to a discussion of this standard treatment, Hamblinâ€™s severe criticism of it, and the reactions which this controversy provoked.The chapter continues with discussions of the contributions of three philosophers who gave new impulses to the study of argumentation: Crawshay-Williams, NÃ¦ss, and Barth. Their contributions to argumentation theory are less familiar than those of Toulmin and Perelman (discussed in Chaps. 4 and 5, respectively), but they are by no means less fundamental. The ideas of the three philosophers reveal a considerable degree of kinship. As is discussed in Sect. 3.7, Crawshay-Williams emphasizes the need for establishing the exact purpose of each statement that is being discussed. Section 3.8 explains that NÃ¦ss, in the same vein, considers it a precondition for a rational exchange of ideas that the participants in a discussion make clear what exactly is being discussed. Section 3.9 makes clear how Barth, inspired by the ideas of Crawshay-Williams and NÃ¦ss, put forward two concepts of validity (â€œobjective validityâ€ and â€œintersubjective validityâ€). Ultimately, any useful concept of validity must not only be acceptable to its users (intersubjectively valid) but also have proved its mettle as a sensible solution to problems of logic or the use of language (objectively valid).'),('10.1007/978-94-007-6994-6_29-3','Design for Values in Nanotechnology','Jacobs, Urjan','Handbook of Ethics, Values, and Technological Design','AbstractApplications of nanotechnology have the potential to raise fundamentally new ethical questions.

However, to be effective, adaptation must be inherently context specific and dynamic to suit the ecological conditions and socioeconomic aspects of any given locale. This poses a dilemma: how can international organizations translate their often broadly defined global mandates, while simultaneously downscaling those mandates to suit the specific adaptation needs of given populations and ecosystems?This research takes a case study approach to investigate the climate change adaptation experience of selected United Nations-led programs, investigating their responses to context-specific needs and highlighting the opportunities and challenges found in these experiences. The case study countries comprised of Bosnia and Herzegovina, China, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Jordan, Mauritania, Mozambique, Peru, and Turkey. Through the use of the 5C+ Protocol theoretical framework, the experiences of these country programs were compared to determine which factors were of greatest influence in successful program implementation.The research concludes that the most significant challenges were: early inclusion of stakeholders to enable support and ownership of adaptation activities, meaningful participation by people at all levels in the identification of problems and solutions, and proper coordination of activities across affected sectors and governance levels. Paying specific attention to these challenges will allow for greater program effectiveness. However, incorporating such measures into adaptation must also include deliberate learning processes, to allow flexibility in response to potential nonlinearities of climate change.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-01904-8_46-1','Networked Seniors','Sugarman, Dov','Handbook of Smart Homes, Health Care and Well-Being','AbstractSocial isolation and loneliness are increasingly prevalent among older adults in Israel, as in the rest of the world.

The first method identifies damage parameters from natural frequencies and mode shapes. Since this is an ill-posed problem, the identified damage parameters from all measurements could be unreliable due to measurement noises. A feasible solution to this problem is using only part of natural frequencies and mode shape points in damage identification. For this purpose, an algorithm based on well-posedness analysis is proposed to select the optimal combination of natural frequencies and mode shape points. Another method is called the Tap-scan damage detection method, which is featured by extracting bridge damage information from the acceleration of a passing vehicle mounted with a well-controlled tapping device. The theoretical basis and hardware setup are presented in detail. In addition, several on-site experiments are given to illustrate its application potential to real bridge structures.The main advantage of these two methods is not requiring traffic blocking during bridge evaluation. Besides, since they extract damage information from the self-comparison of bridge properties among different sections, they do not require the reference state of the intact bridge.

One of the reasons lies in the lack of specific policies for low-income households, which represent about 40 % of Mediterranean households and are considered as far to reach through traditional public policies. Due to their complexity, low-income households require innovative financial approaches for implementation of energy efficiency measures. Smart metering has been identified as one of the climate change adaptation technologies which can be used to encourage people in low-income households to become more aware of their energy consumption and stimulate them to change their energy-related behavior.

The chapter reviews the policy from a social vulnerability perspective. With regard to the socioeconomic and environmental context of Bangladesh, it develops an analytical framework to examine the climate change policy. There is a lack of conceptualizing disaster vulnerability in policy formulation that makes it biased towards â€œphysical adaptationâ€ measures to reduce disaster risk. The political economy of climate change initiatives in Bangladesh leaves little scope to address vulnerability of grassroots communities. The chapter argues that in a country like Bangladesh where lack-of-development-led problems are persistent, there is an urgent need to develop context-responsive policies and action plans that should address the causes and dynamic processes of disaster vulnerability and lack-of-development issues in an integrated manner. Existing climate change policies do not address the structural dynamics of disaster vulnerability adequately.

All bunches are then analyzed in a processor farm and classified in various streams from interesting physics to background, monitoring and calibration events. Finally, all events are stored in appropriate formats. According to first estimates, the event building process will have to cope with 1 to 2 Gigabytes of data per second.

The strong bunching process in klystron-type devices can cause beam electrons to slow down and reverse direction. For these particles the role of DC space-charge forces is important. Here we investigate an improved model for the calculation of such DC forces in TESLA. In the first approximation the space-charge density distribution can be considered as slowly varying along the device axis, and the Poisson equation can be reduced to a 1D version taking into account only the radial dependence of the potential. This allows for a fast solution for the potential \"on the fly\" at every cross-section of the device. With this approach the longitudinal electric field component can be found as the difference of solutions for potential at neighboring cross-sections. However, the 1D approximation becomes strained in devices where the space-charge density varies rapidly in the longitudinal direction. This will happen when particles are dramatically slowed down in the vicinity of the output cavity, or when the electron beam develops scallops with small axial period. In these cases the capability to provide a full 2D solution for the space charge potential becomes very important. The large-signal code TESLA was extended by the addition of a fully 2D Poisson solver, which allow to model more general cases with increased accuracy. The new Poisson solver was applied to cases with a large fraction of slow particles, whose contribution to the space-charge density was found to be significant. To cover the whole device the 2D solver was also extended inside the cavity for each gap region to provide an accurate solution. The main features and results of the new 2D solver are discussed in detail.'),('10.1007/978-3-642-36197-5_64-1','Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) Technology in Earthquake Engineering, Application of','Lu, Xinzheng','Encyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering',''),('10.1007/978-1-4614-9212-2_16-1','Carotid Artery Dissection','Naggara, Olivier','Neurovascular Imaging','AbstractCarotid artery dissections (CAD) are a leading cause of nonatherosclerotic stroke in young adults, responsible for up to 25 % of ischemic strokes. The cornerstone of CAD pathophysiology and diagnosis is the presence of a mural hematoma of unknown etiology, possibly caused by an intimal tear, a primary rupture of vasa vasorum, or an underlying arteriopathy impairing vasomotion. This mural hematoma occurs within the media layer extending distally and circumferentially. The diagnosis of CAD is generally based on a suggestive clinical presentation, exclusion of atherosclerosis, and supportive radiologic evidence. An early and reliable diagnosis is important as anticoagulation or antithrombotic treatment is recommended in order to reduce the risk of an early thromboembolic event. The optimal imaging method for the diagnosis of CAD is still debated. Doppler ultrasound examination (DUS), the first-line screening tool, may show normal findings whenever the mural hematoma results in subtle lumen alterations or is located in a segment that cannot readily be displayed by DUS. Despite the ability of CT angiography to reveal imaging findings of CAD, brain CT is known to be poorly sensitive for the detection of ischemic lesions. Thus, cervical contrast-enhanced MR angiography (CE-MRA) coupled with T1-WI fat-suppressed axial sequences has gradually replaced conventional angiography for the diagnosis of cervical artery dissection. However, the diagnosis of CAD often remains challenging, and it is not rare for the diagnosis of CAD to remain presumptive despite an extensive imaging work-up. The diagnosis can be retrospectively confirmed on imaging follow-up by monitoring the lumen healing or progression in response to treatment. High-resolution MRI (HR-MRI) of the arterial wall is a noninvasive imaging technique that provides a delineation of the lumen and arterial wall. This technique, available at 1.5 and 3-T, which requires standard or dedicated surface coils, has been extensively used for carotid atherosclerosis and, more recently, for carotid dissection.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-04507-8_2-1','High-Gain FEL Theory, Introduction','He, An','Synchrotron Light Sources and Free-Electron Lasers','AbstractThis chapter provides a detailed introduction to the 1D theory of high-gain free electron laserÂ (FEL) and a brief overview of the 3D scaling function for FEL gain.

Our previous work introduced a repository of agile methods that provides evidential knowledge about the needed conditions (requisites) and promised benefits (objectives) of various Agile Method Fragments (AMFs). The knowledge was gathered through systematic review of empirical studies which investigated the enactment of agile methods in various project situations. This paper reports the use of repository in a software process improvement initiative in one of the R&amp;D units of Ericsson Company in Italy.'),('10.1109/AGILE.2011.16','Evolving to Agile: A Story of Agile Adoption at a Small SaaS Company','Matt Block','2011 Agile Conference','Adopting agile practices is often a long process and one for which there is no existing formula for success.

Factor analysis is conducted to identify the clusters of the variables (or items) and how they are inter-related to produce factors. Most of the respondents are from software organisations in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, in which most of the companies are located in Malaysia. The clusters of variables resulting from this analysis can serve as a reference to the practitioners planning to adopt the methodology. The top factors identified from this study are shown in terms of (i) developer involvement and organisation-related aspects, (ii) cultural and people related aspects and (iii) customer collaboration and the need for professional skills when using Agile methods. In addition, factor analysis discovered that practitioners disagreed about the importance of the technical aspects of Agile. While we believe that these findings are particularly important from the Malaysian perspective, however, they also help add to the body of evidence in the field of software engineering and software process particularly in terms of Agile methods adoption.

The CRESCENT framework was previously proposed towards achieving such vision. It managed to satisfy the first three properties, but did not handle the self-protection property. To overcome such limitation, this paper extends CRESCENT and proposes CRESCENT+; a self-protecting framework for reliable composite web service delivery. This is done by performing vulnerability analysis to identify CRESCENT weaknesses, then performing a STRIDE-based threat analysis to identify possible attacks on CRESCENT, and finally proposing different solutions and countermeasures to be integrated into CRESCENT to overcome such problems. Experimental results show that CRESCENT+ increased the reliability of the CRESCENT framework trading off the overall throughput. However, we argue that such loss in the overall throughput is still acceptable as a price for having autonomous composite web services; especially, the obtained overall throughput is still higher than existing industrial standards.'),('10.1007/s10270-018-0679-0','Using language workbenches and domain-specific languages for safety-critical software development','Voelter, Markus','Software & Systems Modeling','AbstractLanguage workbenches support the efficient creation, integration, and use of domain-specific languages.

However, in safety-/mission-critical environments, generated code may not be considered trustworthy, because of the lack of trust in the generation mechanisms. This makes it harder to justify the use of language workbenches in such an environment. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to use such tools in critical environments. We argue that models created with domain-specific languages are easier to validate and that the additional risk resulting from the transformation to code can be mitigated by a suitably designed transformation and verification architecture. We validate the approach with an industrial case study from the healthcare domain.

In this perspective, the paper originally proposes a model and an architecture that loosely federate MANET and FiWi domains based on the interaction of MANET and FiWi controllers: the primary idea is that our MANET and FiWi federated controllers can seldom exchange monitoring data and control hints the one with the other, thus mutually enhancing their capability of packet management over hybrid FiWi-MANET networks.

In this study, the authors approach these new services by conducting a full-factorial experiment where both inexperienced and experienced users take on an analytics task with an analytics-as-a-service technology. The research proves that although experts in analytics still significantly outperform novices, these web-based platforms do offer an advantage to inexperienced users. Furthermore, the authors find that analytics-as-a-service does not offer the same benefits across different analytics tasks. That is, they observe better performance for supervised analytics tasks. Moreover, this study indicates that there are significant differences between novices. The most important distinction lies in the approach they take on the task. Novices who follow a more complex, although structured, workflow behave more similarly to experts and, thus, also perform better.

Proliferation of these hand held devices has made them a common mean to access and process digital information. Most web based applications are today available in a form that can conveniently be accessed over mobile devices. However, web-services (applications meant for consumption by other applications rather than humans) are not as commonly provided/consumed over mobile devices. Facilitating this and in effect realizing a service-oriented system over mobile devices has the potential to further enhance the potential of mobile devices. One of the major challenges in this integration is the lack of an efficient service registry system that caters to issues associated with the dynamic and volatile mobile environments. Existing service registry technologies designed for traditional systems fall short of accommodating such issues. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to manage service registry systems provided â€˜solelyâ€™ over mobile devices, and thus realising an SOA without the need for high-end computing systems. The approach manages a dynamic service registry system in the form of light weight and distributed registries. We assess the feasibility of our approach by engineering and deploying a working prototype of the proposed registry system over actual mobile devices. A comparative study of the proposed approach and the traditional UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) registry is also included.

The focus of this investigation was specifically on achout (gender variant individuals) who were spirit mediums (nat kadaw). Semi-structured interviews explored the ways that participants understood their gender identity, gender expression, and sexuality in relation to their work as spirit mediums and broader social life. Myanmar remains quite a homophobic and transphobic culture but is undergoing rapid economic and social change. Therefore, it provides an interesting context to study how safe spaces are produced for sexual/gender minorities amidst broader social change.

However, most state estimation systems based on visual-inertial sensing suffer from severe processor requirements, which in many cases make them impractical. In this paper, we propose a simple, low-cost and high rate method for state estimation enabling autonomous flight of micro aerial vehicles, which presents a low computational burden. The proposed state estimator fuses observations from an inertial measurement unit, an optical flow smart camera and a time-of-flight range sensor. The smart camera provides optical flow measurements up to a rate of 200Â Hz, avoiding the computational bottleneck to the main processor produced by all image processing requirements. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of extending the use of these smart cameras from hovering-like motions to odometry estimation, producing estimates that are usable during flight times of several minutes. In order to validate and defend the simplest algorithmic solution, we investigate the performances of two Kalman filters, in the extended and error-state flavors, alongside with a large number of algorithm modifications defended in earlier literature on visual-inertial odometry, showing that their impact on filter performance is minimal. To close the control loop, a non-linear controller operating in the special Euclidean group SE(3) is able to drive, based on the estimated vehicleâ€™s state, a quadrotor platform in 3D space guaranteeing the asymptotic stability of 3D position and heading. All the estimation and control tasks are solved on board and in real time on a limited computational unit. The proposed approach is validated through simulations and experimental results, which include comparisons with ground-truth data provided by a motion capture system. For the benefit of the community, we make the source code public.'),('10.1007/s10664-018-9620-y','Software engineering in start-up companies: An analysis of 88 experience reports','Klotins, Eriks','Empirical Software Engineering','AbstractContextStart-up companies have become an important supplier of innovation and software-intensive products.

Such repositories are commonly inspired by reuse mechanisms and help an organization to control and evolve the whole ecosystem to keep it vibrant. In this scenario, it is important to understand how to govern MSECO as well as how reuse mechanisms can support this goal. As such, we investigated governance strategies that emerge from content reuse repositories based on four steps: (1) designing a governance process; (2) performing an initial evaluation of this process with managers who are experts in the main existing MSECO (Apple, Google, Nokia, Microsoft, and Samsung); (3) interviewing 18 MSECO managers to collect opinion about the process; and (4) conducting an exploratory analysis of the MSECO reuse repositoriesâ€™ structure based on the proposed governance process.

However, existing work indicates that few modelling frameworks explicitly include requirements engineering (RE), and that natural language descriptions are still the status quo in RE. Therefore, we aim to increase the understanding of current and potential future use of models in RE, with respect to the automotive domain. In this paper, we report our findings from a multiple-case study with two automotive companies, collecting interview data from 14 practitioners. Our results show that models are used for a variety of different purposes during RE in the automotive domain, e.g. to improve communication and to handle complexity. However, these models are often used in an unsystematic fashion and restricted to few experts. A more widespread use of models is prevented by various challenges, most of which align with existing work on model use in a general sense. Furthermore, our results indicate that there are many potential benefits associated with future use of models during RE. Interestingly, existing research does not align well with several of the proposed use cases, e.g. restricting the use of models to informal notations for communication purposes.

Here, the generic term MDO system refers to the set of disciplinary tools, their exchanged data and process connections that, all together, define an MDO computational setup. In the process leading to the formal specification of such a computational system, the set of tools, data and connections evolves, until a complete MDO system formulation (not executable) is reached. The proposed open-source standard, called CMDOWS (Common MDO Workflow Schema), has been developed to support this process. The key aspect of the format is its neutral XML-based data representation, making any stored MDO system exchangeable between the design team members and applications (e.g., tool repositories, visualization packages) developed to support the team in setting up the MDO system. This exchangeability is a key enabler for the creation of a versatile MDO framework. Furthermore, CMDOWS provides the starting point to translate any MDO system formulation into an executable workflow using a workflow platform of choice. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, such an exchange format does currently not exist, notwithstanding the enormous potential it would have for the exploitation of large-scale MDO in industry. A case study demonstrating the use of CMDOWS is presented in this paper. It was concluded that the current version of CMDOWS already provides a robust standard to store and exchange MDO systems. The schema will be extended to meet future developments and promote its adoption as a recognized standard in the broader MDO community.'),('10.1186/s40411-018-0049-1','Applying user-centered techniques to analyze and design a mobile application','Lopes, Adriana','Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development','AbstractIntroductionTechniques that help in understanding and designing user needs are increasingly being used in Software Engineering to improve the acceptance of applications.

Biodiesel has been considered a strong alternative candidate to petro diesel. Stoichiometrically, one mole of glycerol is generated during the conversion of one mole of triglyceride feedstock or per three produced moles of biodiesel. This an equivalent to 10â€“15% byproduct volume/mass. The biodiesel production has observed a huge jump in production, being preserved as a renewable, sustainable and near CO2 neutral source. This is driven by advances in technology of 1st generation biomass lipid harvesting and advancement of 3rd generation breeding and maximizing algae lipids and their extraction. Therefore, a sound solution for velarizing the glycerol byproduct is becoming a necessity before it is viewed as waste burden. Currently, the glycerol market is saturated and substantial production can lead to an economic imbalance. Therefore, satisfying the energy needs following thermochemical conversion of glycerol into clean syngas fuel is a more favorable and dual solution to the problem, i.e. reducing process waste and generating clean fuel. In this work, the process metrics in using Glycerol as feedstock for the production of syngas fuel is evaluated under pyrolysis then gasification under steam (H2O(g)) and CO2 moderators. Process metrics are assessed using the syngas mole fractions and their normalized value termed as the cold gasification efficiency. The analysis followed equilibrium modeling based on Gibbs Energy Minimization and under sweeping reaction temperatures. The model is validated against experimental literature. Result of glycerol pyrolysis achieved a maximum of 83% at 0.43 CO and 0.57 H2 mole fraction. Glycerol gasification under steam moderator resulted in a slightly higher efficiency of 84% and 0.20 CO and 0.55 H2 mole fractions, while under CO2 moderator resulted in a lower efficiency of 80% and 0.40 CO and 0.30 H2 mole fractions.

Printed electronics is regarded as a promising industry of the future because of its relatively low cost, simple process, and high mass production capacity, which are all superior to existing manufacturing methods. Roll-to-roll printing is a suitable technology for printed electronics with large-scale and high-speed mass production. To commercialize roll-to-roll printing technology, it is necessary to develop technology for position control of the web, tension control of the web, printing pressure control, and functional ink development. Among them, the printing pressure uniformization by the printing pressure control is an important factor that significantly affects the printing quality. In the roll-to-roll printing process, the functional ink is transferred by the nip generated by the printing pressure. That is, if the nip can be kept uniform by applying the printing pressure uniformly, the uniformity of the line width and thickness of the printed pattern is improved. This nip occurs on a line connecting the geometric center of the two rolls, and the centers of the two rolls are on the orbit line by each roll runout. Therefore, the print pressure can be estimated through the change in the inter-center distance of the rolls caused by the roll runout. In this study, we propose a method of printing pressure uniformization using roll runout.

We investigate two DN architectures for change detection, the first one is based on the idea of stacking contraction and expansion blocks while the second one is based on the idea of Fully Convolutional Networks. To train and evaluate our networks we introduce a new urban change detection dataset which is an order of magnitude larger than existing datasets and contains challenging changes due to seasonal and lighting variations.

Groundnut milk contained higher total solids (15.923Â g/100Â g), fat (5.74Â g/100Â g) and its yoghurt contained 18.153Â g/100Â g total solids and 5.430Â g/100Â g fat. These products also had a higher calorific value, 417Â kJ/100Â g and 379.5Â kJ/100Â g respectively. The apparent viscosity of groundnut milk was higher than cow milk at all shear rates and there was a close relationship between viscosity and shear rates. The water holding capacity of groundnut milk yoghurt was 65.68Â g/100Â g and significantly higher than cow milk yoghurt sample (44.27Â g/100Â g).

It records the rise and fall of a nationalist developmental project in Syria through an analysis of class relations. It highlights an essential continuity in the nature of class reproduction from the late Ottoman to the early independence period, centered on the conservative nationalism of the mercantile ruling bloc. It associates the rise of a national developmental project with the politicization of the â€œmiddle classes,â€ which occupied a central role in the state apparatus. This class represented the main driving force behind the expansion of the boundaries of political power and the process of nation building. It is the class polarization of society that fuelled the development of a nation-building project and favored the creation of a national populist alliance against the monopoly of traditional ruling classes.

The localization properties of disordered systems are expected to be dramatically sensitive to their symmetries. So far, this question has been little explored experimentally. Here we investigate the realization of an artificial gauge field in a synthetic (temporal) dimension of a disordered, periodically driven quantum system. Tuning the strength of this gauge field allows us to control the parityâ€“time symmetry properties of the system, which we probe through the experimental observation of three symmetry-sensitive signatures of localization. The first two are the coherent backscattering, marker of weak localization, and the recently predicted coherent forward scattering, genuine interferential signature of Anderson localization. The third is the direct measurement of the Î²(g) scaling function in two different symmetry classes, allowing to demonstrate its universality and the one-parameter scaling hypothesis.Periodically kicked rotors are useful in exploring localization phenomenon. Here the authors use ultracold Cs atoms kicked by short laser pulses and show that the periodic modulation results into interference signals as a signature of weak and strong localizations.'),('10.1007/s41030-018-0051-0','Identifying Critical Errors: Addressing Inhaler Technique in the Context of Asthma Management','Bosnic-Anticevich, Sinthia Z.','Pulmonary Therapy','AbstractMedication use has always played a highly significant role in the overall management of asthma, with appropriate use being linked to good asthma control.

Model tests and the corresponding numerical modeling were conducted to validate the serviceability of the Micropile-MSE wall and the reliability of the numerical method. Then, a parametric study of the stress and deformation of Micropile-MSE wall based on the backfill strength and interfacial friction angle between backfill and backslope is conducted to evaluate its performance. The test results indicate that the surcharge-induced horizontal earth pressure, base pressure and lateral displacement of the wall panel of Micropile-MSE wall decrease. The corresponding numerical results are nearly equal to the measured values. The basic failure mode of MSE wall in steep terrain is the sliding of backfill along the backslope, while A-frame style micropiles are capable of preventing the sliding trend. The maximum resultant displacement can be decreased by 6.25% to 46.9% based on different interfacial friction angles, and the displacement can be reduced by 6% ~ 56.1% based on different backfill strengths. Furthermore, the reduction increases when the interfacial friction angle and internal friction angle of backfill decrease.

Despite various successful applications in construction projects, specifically improvement of marginal sand (i.e., loose poorly graded sand) using new materials in the viewpoint of strength development is still open for the attempt of deep mixing regarding the binder of grout, curing time and clay content. Thus, in this paper, effect of glass powder added to cement-based slurry grout in different proportions (0, 3, 6, 9% by dry weight of binder) has been experimentally investigated for deep mixing of marginal sand with various clay contents (4, 8, 20%). An experimental program has been developed for this purpose conducting the Vicat, unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) tests for the performances of soilcrete samples. From the testing results, it is found that: (i) The glass powder is not able to accelerate the setting times of grout, (ii) the bulk density does not significantly change with the glass powder, clay content and curing time, (iii) the most performed UCS value is obtained due to the addition of 3% glass powder at the 28-day curing for the soilcrete samples of 20% clay content of sand, while all UCS magnitudes obtained for the soilcrete samples are considered acceptable for the construction of soilâ€“cement column, (iv) the elastic modulus correlates well with the UCS values (R$$ge $$â‰¥ 0.83) at the majority of soilcrete samples and (v) the UPV values of soilcrete samples at 28-day curing perform better due to the addition of 3% glass powder similar to the response trend of UCS, while their performances are higher due to 4% clay content in contrast to the trend of UCS. As a consequence, this study demonstrates the use of glass powder added grout to be beneficial for deep mixing of marginal sand, in which 20% clay inclusion contributes more.'),('10.1007/s11269-018-1910-z','Acknowledgement of Reviewers','','Water Resources Management',''),('10.1007/978-1-4614-9213-9_440-1','Flat-Floored Crater','Plescia, Jeffrey B.','Encyclopedia of Planetary Landforms',''),('10.1007/978-3-642-37179-0_4-5','Wollastonites','Zilles, Joerg Ulrich','Encyclopedia of Polymers and Composites',''),('10.1007/978-3-642-36197-5_95-1','Spatial Filtering for Structural Health Monitoring','Tondreau, G.','Encyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering',''),('10.1007/978-1-4614-8968-9_38-1','Micromechanical Models of Ductile Damage and Fracture','Benzerga, A.

This way, also 1,2-cis glycosides were accessible with reactive, sterically not-demanding glycosyl acceptors.

Diagnosis relies on a stereotypical appearance and location at non-branch points on the internal carotid artery at angiography, together with inspection at surgery. They are increasingly seen involving other intracranial arteries and generally considered to be caused by atherosclerotic mural disease.Surgical clipping is difficult because of their small size, sessile shape, and thin sac walls. It is frequently complicated by operative rupture, and alternative wrapping and trapping are often required. For these reasons, endovascular treatments are increasingly used as an alternative. The recent introduction of high mesh density stents, designed to redirect blood flow away from aneurysms and reinforce the parent artery, has stimulated the development of new procedures to manage these lesions.

We intend, using the extraordinarily complex development as a basis, to give a historical overview of the emergence of concepts that are of particular importance from the point of view of cliometrics. We shall start by describing the beginnings of modern probability theory, along with its connection with other statistical approaches. The following overview covers the basic principles of the current concepts of inference developed by R. A. Fisher on one hand and by J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson on the other. Neo-Bayesian approaches have meanwhile been developed in parallel, although they were not taken into account during the initial founding phase of econometrics. A â€œclassicâ€ approach was instead adopted in this respect, albeit with an additional difficulty: the taking into account of time. Cliometrics initially followed a Bayesian approach, but this did not finally prevail. Following on from econometrics, a correspondingly classic, inference-based position was adopted. This chapter concludes with a reference to a fundamental critique of the classic position by Rudolf Kalman, which we also find very promising as an inference-related concept for cliometrics.

These spare, unpredictable networks aim to solve the prolonged delay paths by a store-carry-forward scheme. It is difficult to determine the appropriate nodes to forward the messages since there are few opportunistic contacts. The nodes might decide based on the obtained data of the network as a guide to reach a destination. The aforementioned technique is not helpful in case the rate of change in the network topology is higher than the rate of data gathering due to usage restrictions and uncertain available information/knowledge of the future contacts. In this paper, to cope with the challenges imposed by the un-deterministic environment, a risk assessment strategy is considered to evaluate the short and long-term impact of each decision to find the optimal node/paths. This routing scheme can take advantage of the unanticipated connection to make the routing more flexible in short time and with less buffer usage. Our proposed risk assessment algorithms that are based on MALP are mixed with the knowledge about buffer management and network capacity. The prioritized messages to be disseminated as well as better decision to take a risk are the main contributions of this paper. Moreover, the self-adaptive threshold, distributed PID controller, is considered to tackle different threshold levels for each node individually.

Safety engineering employs simple design principles or rules of thumb such as inherent safety, multiple barriers, and numerical safety margins to reduce the risk of accidents. Probabilistic risk analysis combines the probabilities of individual events in event chains leading to accidents in order to identify design elements in need of improvement and often also to optimize the use of resources. It is proposed that the two methodologies should be seen as complementary rather than as competitors.

The water domain is indeed the scene of reorientation and transformation, though from a perspective of design for values much remains to be desired. This chapter discusses these matters, investigates present water approaches, and indicates how value considerations have always been implicitly present in such approaches. Three approaches for dealing with water affairs are distinguished: the technical-economic approach, integrated water resources management, and the negotiated approach. In this sequence, value considerations have become increasingly important. In addition to suggesting improvements, we will present a step-by-step plan for a more explicit design for values approach, as the way to move forward in dealing with global water issues.'),('10.1007/978-3-642-36197-5_164-1','Uncertainty Theories, Overview','Elwood, E.','Encyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering',''),('10.1007/978-94-007-6994-6_5-1','Conflicting Values in Design for Values','Poel, Ibo','Handbook of Ethics, Values, and Technological Design','AbstractDesigners are regularly confronted with conflicting values in design: different values select different design options as best. This contribution deals with how one can deal with such value conflicts in design for values. A characterization of value conflict in design is given, and the notion is compared with the notion of moral dilemmas. It is further argued that value conflicts in design entail a kind of multi-criteria decision problems to which Arrowâ€™s impossibility theorem applies. This theorem says that there is no procedure to aggregate scores on individual criteria (values) into an overall score unless one is willing to violate one of more minimally reasonable conditions for any such an aggregation procedure. Six methods to deal with value conflicts (cost-benefit analysis, direct trade-offs, maximin, satisficing, judgment, and innovation) are discussed. Three of these avoid Arrowâ€™s theorem by assuming a form of value commensurability, although they may be too informationally demanding and have other disadvantages as well. The other three are non-optimizing methods that do not result in one best solution and therefore do not entirely solve the value conflict, although they are a way forward in some respects. In conclusion, an approach that combines the several methods is proposed as a way to deal with cases of conflicting moral values in design and which avoids many of the disadvantages of the single methods.'),('10.1007/978-3-642-36197-5_116-1','Earthquake Return Period and Its Incorporation into Seismic Actions','Tsompanakis, Yiannis','Encyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering',''),('10.1007/978-3-642-36197-5_202-1','Assessment of Existing Structures Using Response History Analysis','Grant, Damian N.','Encyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering',''),('10.1007/978-94-007-6994-6_8-1','Design for Values and Operator Roles in Sociotechnical Systems','Franssen, Maarten','Handbook of Ethics, Values, and Technological Design','AbstractEngineering is increasingly of systems that are not only complex â€“ in being multilayered â€“ but also hybrid â€“ in containing people as components. This chapter does not discuss the already well-researched safety concerns generated by this development with respect to operators, users, and bystanders but instead addresses values of relevance to the presence in such systems of operators as agents: values associated with what we can reasonably ask people to do and what we make people responsible for. From the perspective of design, systems containing people as components deviate in four ways from traditional systems consisting of all-hardware components. (1) Such systems are not designed as a whole but gradually and modularly. (2) They are typically delivered as incomplete because their operators have to be added by the client or owner during implementation; only operator roles are strictly speaking designed. (3) Persons performing these roles become components of the system only partially; unlike hardware components their behavior continues to be monitored and controlled from a perspective external to the system. (4) Operator roles are often explicitly conceived as being partially external, in that an operatorâ€™s task is ultimately to ensure that the system continues to function properly come what may. These features lead to conflicts with the autonomy of operators as persons and the well-foundedness of assigning particular responsibilities to them. The difficulties described here should make us rethink whether traditional engineering approaches to system design are adequate for such hybrid systems.'),('10.1007/978-3-642-36197-5_114-1','Selection of Ground Motions for Response History Analysis','Sextos, Anastasios G.','Encyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering',''),('10.1007/978-94-007-6165-0_72-2','Technology, Assessing Understanding of','Quellmalz, Edys','Encyclopedia of Science Education',''),('10.1007/978-3-642-36197-5_207-1','Strengthening Techniques: Code-Deficient Steel Buildings','Tsavdaridis, Konstantinos Daniel','Encyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering',''),('10.1007/978-3-642-36197-5_19-1','Liquefaction: Countermeasures to Mitigate Risk','Orense, P.

However, these inelastic phenomena do result in significant damages to structures, including not only distributed cracking, which is damage in classical sense, but also damage in the form of excessive deflection which puts the structure out of service. It is for this reason that a chapter on creep and shrinkage is included in this handbook. The theory of creep and shrinkage of concrete has become a vast field. In what follows, only a rather brief exposition of this subject will be included. The emphasis will be on the topics of wide recent interest, triggered by the revelation of practical problems that have been synthesized into a coherent picture only during the last few years. The creep effects are particularly important for super-tall buildings and prestressed concrete structures, because of their slenderness and high flexibility, and are paramount for nuclear reactor containments and vessels. At high-temperature exposure, as in fire in tunnels or tall buildings or in postulated nuclear reactor accidents, creep is very large and plays a major role.'),('10.1007/978-3-642-36197-5_239-1','Stochastic Ground Motion Simulation','Rezaeian, Sanaz','Encyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering',''),('10.1007/978-3-642-36197-5_19-2','Liquefaction: Countermeasures to Mitigate Risk','Orense, Rolando P.','Encyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering',''),('10.1109/JPROC.2018.2827438','Nikola Tesla&#x2019;s True Wireless: A Paradigm Missed','A.

Here, we use cue-conflict experiments to investigate the interplay between these two routines in ants, Cataglyphis noda, which start their foraging careers (novices) with learning walks and are then tested at different stages of experience. During their learning walks, the novices take nest-centered views from various directions around the nest. In the present experiments, these learning walks are spatially restricted by arranging differently sized water moats around the nest entrance and thus, limiting the space available around the nest and the nest-feeder route. First, we show that the ants are able to return to the nest by landmark guidance only when the novices have had enough space around the nest entrance for properly performing their learning walks. Second, in 180Â° cue-conflict situations between path integration and landmark guidance, path integration dominates in the beginning of foraging life (after completion of the learning walks), but with increasing numbers of visits to a familiar feeder landmark guidance comes increasingly into play.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-78568-4_6','Design Teams Versus the Lone Designer','Chen, Steven','The Design Imperative','AbstractResearch has shown that multidisciplinary teams are more effective than lone effort in design tasks in terms of innovation.

MHD is relatively young in natural science and engineering starting with the pioneering work of Hartmann (Hg-Dynamics-I, Math-Fys. MLA, 1937, [34]) in liquid metal duct flow under the influence of a strong external MF. Under such circumstances, the motion of the electrically conducting fluids generate the electric current and the Lorentz force, and as a consequence, the flow field is coupled and varied with the induced electromagnetic field. Today the research in MHD maybe subdivided into two purposes, there are on the one hand fluid mechanics and applied mathematics because of its complex flow characteristics, such as the MHD instability and the MHD turbulence, which contain particular dynamic behaviors due to the coupling of the flow field and the electromagnetic field. On the other hand, it is also very important in industrial production processes and technology applications, whose working principle is based on the MHD effects, which may be effective in optimizing and controlling the liquid flows in metallurgical and casting industries. Furthermore, the development of MHD pumping devices and the electromagnetic voltmeter also depends on the research in MHD flows. In addition, MHD has been advanced significantly during the last three decades by efforts to take the massive energy out of magnetic-confinement fusion device, which is thought as the most potential energy in future, and therefore, the flow characteristics and the heat transfer in liquid metal flows such as lithium or lithium lead under the influence of MHD effect deserves more attention. The design and construction of a liquid metal fusion blanket or fusion divertor requires detailed knowledge of MHD duct flows and MHD free surface flows.'),('10.1007/s11227-017-2168-6','Real-time parallel image processing applications on multicore CPUs with OpenMP and GPGPU with CUDA','Aydin, Semra','The Journal of Supercomputing','AbstractThis paper presents real-time image processing applications using multicore and multiprocessing technologies.

Ein progressives Widerstandstraining fÃ¼r alle groÃŸen Muskelgruppen und AktivitÃ¤ten mit Belastungen durch das eigene KÃ¶rpergewicht haben einen positiven Effekt auf die Knochendichte. Derartige regelmÃ¤ÃŸig durchgefÃ¼hrte AktivitÃ¤ten erhÃ¶hen die Knochendichte oder bremsen zumindest deren physiologischen Abbau. Ãœbungen mit niedriger IntensitÃ¤t und ohne KÃ¶rpergewichtsbelastung zeigen keinen Effekt auf die Knochendichte. Eine Bewegungstherapie bei Patienten mit Osteoporose muss dies berÃ¼cksichtigen. Eine Remobilisierung nach Frakturen muss mit dem Ziel, den Knochendichteverlust durch InaktivitÃ¤t zu vermeiden, rasch eingeleitet und, falls erforderlich, durch eine Schmerztherapie ergÃ¤nzt werden. Ziele einer rehabilitativen Bewegungstherapie sind die Erhaltung oder Verbesserung der Gelenkbeweglichkeit und KÃ¶rperbalance und die MuskelkrÃ¤ftigung zur Vermeidung des RundrÃ¼ckens und zur Funktionserhaltung von Armen und Beinen.

Green biotechnology involves, among others, processes such as development of pest resistant plants, new plant derived drugs and new nutritive plants. Research in this area offers possibilities for the development of new food products and mechanisms for the control of pathogenic agents in foods. In Bosnia and Herzegovina green biotechnology is slowly developing branch of biotechnology. If we consider last two years, green biotechnology in Bosnia and Herzegovina produced less than 10 research papers, in the same time period neighbouring countries have developed research laboratories for green biotechnology and are successfully applying for HORIZON 2020 grants (example of Sinisa StankoviÄ‡ Institute â€“ FP7 - Plant Terpenoids for Human Health: a chemical and genomic approach to identify and produce bioactive compounds). Why is this the case? First of all the average laboratory for plant in vitro culture oriented for evaluation of gene expression and metabolic engineering costs around 1 million euros. The field is constantly evolving and the costs of making the laboratory productive rises even more. Governmental supported projects in B&H are usually around 10 000 euros and it is impossible to establish such laboratory without international projects. HORIZON 2020 usually seen as a golden goose by the researchers, offers large projects but for a scientist, dealing with green biotechnology, from Bosnia and Herzegovina (speaking from my own experience, after 8 years working in green biotechnology field) to apply for such founds is a borderline science fiction. We are enclosed in vicious circle of different roadblocks in the process of making green biotechnology interesting for the researchers and students in Bosnia and Herzegovina. First of all funding of the green biotechnology projects is usually considered to be less important than biomedical engineering. We are forgetting that in pursuit for new medicines in this era of the emergence of antibiotic resistance we must return our focus to green biotechnology and plant metabolic engineering. By stimulating students to pursue career in green biotechnology we are investing in our future, in new medicines, in new food products and crop resistant to pests. For this reason, by developing better plants we are stopping the consequences before they emerge, like the effects of pesticides.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-54487-8_13','The Star of the Sibyl: Analysis and History of a Late Medieval Illustrated Prophecy','Gandolfi, Giangiacomo','The Light, The Stones and The Sacred','AbstractMisinterpreted and overlooked in its astrological meaning for a long time, the so-called â€œcaricature of the Emperor and the Popeâ€ of the late XVth century is actually a complex stratification of joachimist traditions and at the same time an extraordinary example of how an anonymous and ambiguous engraving imbued with apocalypticism could have left a mark on the history of culture, spreading and adapting across the centuries.

Our results determined a significantly positive effect on overall fractures, whereas the possibility of a publication bias indicates the need for well-designed (multi-center) trials that generate enough power to focus on osteoporotic fractures.IntroductionThe preventive effect of exercise on fracture incidence has not been clearly determined yet. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise in preventing overall and vertebral fractures in older adults by meta-analyses technique.MethodsThis study followed the PRISMA recommendations for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. A systematic review of English articles between 1980 and March 2012 was performed. Terms used were: â€œexerciseâ€, â€œfracturesâ€, â€œboneâ€, â€œfallsâ€, â€œosteoporosisâ€, â€œBMDâ€, â€œBMCâ€, â€œbone turnoverâ€, while the search was limited to â€œclinical trialâ€ and â€œhumansâ€. Controlled exercise trials that reported fracture number as endpoint or observation in subjects 45Â years and older were included.ResultsTen controlled exercise trials that reported overall fractures and three exercise trials that reported vertebral fractures met our inclusion criteria. Overall fracture number in the exercise group was 36 (nâ€‰=â€‰754) compared with 73 fractures in the CG (nâ€‰=â€‰670) (relative risk [RR]â€‰=â€‰0.49; 95Â % confidence interval [CI], 0.31â€“0.76). No significant heterogeneity of trial results (pâ€‰=â€‰0.28; I2â€‰=â€‰17) was determined; however, there was some evidence to suggest a publication bias. The overall RR for vertebral fracture number (0.56; 95Â % CI, 0.30â€“1.04) (EG: 19 fractures/103 subjects vs. CG: 31 fractures/102 subjects) was borderline non-significant while the heterogeneity of trial results also cannot be ruled out.ConclusionAlthough there is evidence that exercise reduces overall and, to a lesser degree, vertebral fractures in the elderly, the possibility of publication bias weakens our result and demonstrates the imperative for large exercise studies with dedicated exercise protocols that focus on fractures as a primary endpoint.'),('10.1007/s10624-013-9292-3','Beneath the master narrative: human trafficking, myths of sexual slavery and ethnographic realities','Snajdr, Edward','Dialectical Anthropology','AbstractThis paper explores the disconnections between anti-trafficking discourse and the local experience of responding to human trafficking as indicated in ethnographic data from Bosnia and Kazakhstan. Using the concept of â€œuptake,â€ I examine how anti-trafficking discourse operates as a master narrative, drawing on techniques of emotion and logic, as well as a specific type of victim story. I also consider how, despite an emerging counter discourse that questions the data and challenges current policy, human trafficking discourse continues to be retold in media and reproduced in popular culture, often in ways that actually diverge from the current version of the grand narrative. In contrast to these uncritical representations, ethnographic data from Bosnia suggest that the master narrative is selective in how it represents the history of the problem and that it does not â€œtake upâ€ important details about the context that fosters sexual exploitation, despite Bosniaâ€™s compliance with US policy. Conversely, Kazakhstan suffers a liminal status regardless of local efforts to prevent the problem from happening within its borders as well as evidence that the crime is not widespread.

Experimental results show that this method can achieve early detection of fire accident with high accuracy and stronger anti-jamming ability.'),('10.1109/ICIP.2008.4712020','Reliable smoke detection in the domains of image energy and color','Paolo Piccinini','2008 15th IEEE International Conference on Image Processing','Smoke detection calls for a reliable and fast distinction between background, moving objects and variable shapes that are recognizable as smoke. In our system we propose a stable background suppression module joined with a smoke detection module working on segmented objects. It exploits two features: the energy variation in wavelet model and a color model of the smoke. The decrease of energy ratio in wavelet domain between background and current image is a clue to detect smoke representing the variations of texture level. A mixture of Gaussians models this texture ratio for temporal evolution. The color model is used as reference to measure the deviation of the current pixel color from the model. The two features have been combined using a Bayesian classifier to detect smoke in the scene. Experiments on real data and a comparison between our background model and Gaussian mixture (MOG) model for smoke detection are presented.'),('10.1109/ASC-ICSC.2008.4675428','Optimal method for interfering with infrared homing missile by airborne infrared smoke','Zhongxiang Tong','2008 Asia Simulation Conference - 7th International Conference on System Simulation and Scientific Computing','As the equipment with high performance-cost ratio, infrared smoke is widely used in the ground infrared countermeasure. But from the air-to-air countermeasure aspect, for the impact of high speed airflow, it is difficult to interfere with the infrared homing missile effectively by the infrared smoke. To overcome this problem, the infrared countermeasure for the complex system which includes combat aircraft target, infrared smoke and infrared homing missile is simulated. Integrating the launching time and initial velocity of the infrared Smoke with the optimal elusion rule of the combat aircraft target, the system simulation not only solves the effect of high speed airflow on the infrared smoke, but also gets the optimal method for interfering with the infrared homing missile by the airborne infrared smoke.'),('10.1109/CISP.2008.397','An Early Fire Detection Method Based on Smoke Texture Analysis and Discrimination','Yu Cui','2008 Congress on Image and Signal Processing','Texture is an important property of fire smoke, which is a significant signal for early fire detection.

We may therefore expect its use to cease to be a novelty and become part of the normal routine. However, telecare (a set of technologies used for care at a distance) is not yet part of the daily routine for nurses. They still have to do a lot of work to accommodate telecare, or they choose not to work with telecare at all. The extra work associated with telecare stems from the fact that telecare is often additional to regular care and involves all kinds of changes to regular work processes. In this chapter, telecare practices are looked at closely in order to find out what happens. By zooming in and looking at nursing telecare practices from different angles, we seek to answer two main questions: what kinds of (small-scale) changes in nursing care are brought about by technology and how can nurses deal with them? The conclusion is that changes brought about by technology can change the work processes, values, and care practices that nurses are used to. Nurses experience how telecare introduces new forms of nursing care, which, being new, require the formation and, when necessary, revision of professional opinions. Research into what the new practices involve will help nurses to form professional opinions and deal with the changes taking place within their profession.'),('10.1007/978-1-4614-9610-6_9-1','Epidemiology of Non-AIDS-Defining Malignancies','Grulich, Andrew E.','Encyclopedia of AIDS',''),('10.1007/978-3-319-03751-6_75-1','Polysaccharides from Aloe vera and Oral Ulcerations','Bhalang, Kanokporn','Polysaccharides','AbstractAloe veraAloe vera is a locally grown herbal plant.

Acemannan is composed of Î²-(1â€‰â†’â€‰4)-acetylated polymannose chains. Acemannan has been reported to accelerate oral wound healing in animal studies. Recurrent aphthous ulcerations are common painful oral mucosal ulcers that affect the quality of life of patients. Clinically, acemannan is effective in reducing both ulcer size and associated pain.

Protective factors can result from external sources (social control) and internal sources (internalized conventional values). They generate nonmaterial benefits in the case of compliance and/or nonmaterial costs in the case of non-compliance. The inclusion of protective factor into regulatory analysis â€“ in combination with the consideration of risk factors that work in the opposite direction â€“ helps to understand why some regulatory regimes work better than others.

Loss of each branch leads to a different phenotype in mice, some of which are similar to human disorders, such as diabetes and lung emphysema, indicating that each branch has intrinsic functions in vivo. The defects in these knockout mice are often caused by impaired functions of a specific target protein, which would carry a specific branch on its N-glycan in wild-type mice.

This is more evident when projects last a long time and the teams are large. In this work, a student team accepted to use SCRUM as their project management methodology during their Project Based Learning (PjBL) experience. This PjBL experience took place on the 7th semester of the Integrated Master in Industrial Engineering and Management degree. The team had a short period of time to train the technique and apply it throughout the entire semester. Although not very enthusiastic in the beginning of the project, the team gradually became aware of the advantages of SCRUM features, recognizing the feeling of having the project under control and gaining management effectiveness throughout the semester. In the end, the team performed well above the average, being one of the two teams with the highest score of the class.'),('10.1007/978-981-10-8588-8_3','Stuttgart Regionâ€”Sustainable Industrialization in Stuttgart Metropolitan Region','Hertwig, Michael','Smart Metropolitan Regional Development','AbstractThe Stuttgart region is a very prosperous area. The economical backbone of the region is the production of industrial goods. The globalization is a trigger for changing economical dependencies. Industrial processes are changing because of the new challenges. Digitalization is a current topic which has huge influence on economical procedures. A main topic in this context is the German initiative â€œIndustry 4.0â€. New ways of thinking have a great impact on the way manufacturing is done and the digitalization opens up new possibilities. Current discussions on sustainability are influencing the economic thinking heavily. The importance of sustainable development with respect to environment and climate becomes more and more obvious to everybody. The climate conference in Paris was finished with a consensus of all present parties. Every important economic nation has a common sense on climate targets nowadays. Reasons for that are manifold, e.g. limited resources and huge amount of emissions. Nevertheless, society will only accept limitations, without a reduction of living quality. Based on that, it is necessary to implement a new procedures in existing structures. Additionally, it is required to implement changes without reducing economic potentials. The approach of symbiosis can support these developments. However, technology is a required extension to reach the target of sustainability. In this chapter, different views are discussed to facilitate long-term development. The first view is a holistic view. The idea of creating a symbiosis between enterprises in an industrial estate is easy to realize. On one hand the enterprise manager are able to shape the collaborations, and on the other hand the local administration is able to support the approach with small efforts. Besides the sustainable development of industrial estates the companies need a strategy for their own development. A development path towards urban manufacturing is helping the management of companies to create a strategy. A concrete step-by-step approach is the base. Additional technological drivers are analyzed in their capability of supporting sustainability.'),('10.1007/s11069-018-3366-0','Crowdsourcing for forensic disaster investigations: Hurricane Harvey case study','Yuan, Faxi','Natural Hazards','AbstractA critical prerequisite of risk prevention measures for natural hazards is from the results of forensic disaster investigations (FDIs). The current studies of the FDIs are limited by data issues including data availability and data reliability. The applications of crowdsourcing method in natural disasters indicate the potential to provide data support for the FDIs. However, there is very limited existing research on the use of crowdsourcing data for the FDIs. Following the requirements published by the Integrated Research on Disaster Risk program for FDIs, this paper establishes the process map for conducting the FDIs by scenario analysis approach with the crowdsourcing and crowdsensor data. Hurricane Harvey is used as the case study to implement the process map. The results show that the use of crowdsourcing data for the FDIs is feasible. Though this paper takes practical measures for improving the reliability of crowdsourcing data (i.e., little data size) in the case study, future research can focus on the development of advanced algorithm for the crowdsourcing data quality validation.'),('10.1007/s11219-016-9350-6','Considerations about quality in model-driven engineering','Giraldo, FÃ¡ber D.','Software Quality Journal','AbstractThe virtue of quality is not itself a subject; it depends on a subject. In the software engineering field, quality means good software products that meet customer expectations, constraints, and requirements. Despite the numerous approaches, methods, descriptive models, and tools, that have been developed, a level of consensus has been reached by software practitioners. However, in the model-driven engineering (MDE) field, which has emerged from software engineering paradigms, quality continues to be a great challenge since the subject is not fully defined. The use of models alone is not enough to manage all of the quality issues at the modeling language level. In this work, we present the current state and some relevant considerations regarding quality in MDE, by identifying current categories in quality conception and by highlighting quality issues in real applications of the model-driven initiatives. We identified 16 categories in the definition of quality in MDE. From this identification, by applying an adaptive sampling approach, we discovered the five most influential authors for the works that propose definitions of quality. These include (in order): the OMG standards (e.g., MDA, UML, MOF, OCL, SysML), the ISO standards for software quality models (e.g., 9126 and 25,000), Krogstie, Lindland, and Moody. We also discovered families of works about quality, i.e., works that belong to the same author or topic. Seventy-three works were found with evidence of the mismatch between the academic/research field of quality evaluation of modeling languages and actual MDE practice in industry. We demonstrate that this field does not currently solve quality issues reported in industrial scenarios. The evidence of the mismatch was grouped in eight categories, four for academic/research evidence and four for industrial reports. These categories were detected based on the scope proposed in each one of the academic/research works and from the questions and issues raised by real practitioners. We then proposed a scenario to illustrate quality issues in a real information system project in which multiple modeling languages were used. For the evaluation of the quality of this MDE scenario, we chose one of the most cited and influential quality frameworks; it was detected from the information obtained in the identification of the categories about quality definition for MDE. We demonstrated that the selected framework falls short in addressing the quality issues. Finally, based on the findings, we derive eight challenges for quality evaluation in MDE projects that current quality initiatives do not address sufficiently.'),('10.1007/s11219-017-9364-8','Recognising object-oriented software design quality: a practitioner-based questionnaire survey','Stevenson, Jamie','Software Quality Journal','AbstractDesign quality is vital if software is to be maintainable. What practices do developers actually use to achieve design quality in their day-to-day work and which of these do they find most useful? To discover the extent to which practitioners concern themselves with object-oriented design quality and the approaches used when determining quality in practice, a questionnaire survey of 102 software practitioners, approximately half from the UK and the remainder from elsewhere around the world was used. Individual and peer experience are major contributors to design quality. Classic design guidelines, well-known lower level practices, tools and metrics all can also contribute positively to design quality. There is a potential relationship between testing practices and design quality. Inexperience, time pressures, novel problems, novel technology, and imprecise or changing requirements may have a negative impact on quality. Respondents with most experience are more confident in their design decisions, place more value on reviews by team leads and are more likely to rate design quality as very important. For practitioners, these results identify the techniques and tools that other practitioners find effective. For researchers, the results highlight a need for more work investigating the role of experience in the design process and the contribution experience makes to quality. There is also the potential for more in-depth studies of how practitioners are actually using design guidance, including Clean Code. Lastly, the potential relationship between testing practices and design quality merits further investigation.'),('10.1007/s10696-018-9314-1','Distribution planning for products with varying life cycles','Sainathuni, Bhanuteja','Flexible Services and Manufacturing Journal','AbstractDistribution planning becomes increasingly complex when warehouses handle products with varying life cycles; long (basic) and short (fashion). The varying demand patterns and life-cycles associated with each product class require different planning decisions possibly with different objectives; cost-efficiency for basic products and time-responsiveness for fashion products. Although it may appear that such products may be handled separately from inventory and transportation perspectives, they certainly are inseparable at the warehouse as they often get handled simultaneously by the same warehouse resources (i.e., workers and technology). To address this challenge, we introduce a novel problem to the literature, the two-product class, multi-product quantities, multi-echelon, multi-period, distribution planning problem. The uniqueness of this problem is in jointly deriving optimal distribution plans for both product classes, combined with optimal warehouse design decisions (e.g., technology and workforce), in order to minimize the total cost. We model this problem as a mixed-integer bilinear optimization problem, which turns out to be computationally challenging when dealing with industry-size instances (e.g., 200 stores, 1000 products, and 28 time-periods). We, therefore, propose a heuristic based on the iterative local search framework and conduct a comprehensive experimental study. Results suggest that with an increase in the proportion of fashion products, there is a substantial increase in warehouse workload variation, and subsequently total cost. An increase in fashion window tends to mitigate the variation and so do situations where the warehouse is located in regions with higher worker costs.'),('10.1007/s11219-017-9363-9','Round-trip engineering with the Two-Tier Programming Toolkit','Eden, A.H.','Software Quality Journal','AbstractA major impediment to the long-term quality of large and complex programs is inconsistency between design and implementation. Conflicts between intent and execution are common because detecting them is laborious, error-prone, and poorly supported, and because the costs of continuously maintaining design documents outweigh immediate gains. A growing inconsistency between design and implementation results in software that is unpredictable and poorly understood. Round-trip engineering tools support an iterative process of detecting conflicts and resolving them by changing either the design or the implementation. We describe a Toolkit which supports a round-trip engineering of native Java programs without interfering with any existing practices, tools, or development environments, thereby posing a minimal barrier on adoption. The Toolkit includes a user-guided software visualization and design recovery tool, which generates Codecharts from source code. A â€œround-tripâ€ process is possible because Codecharts visualizing source code can be edited to reflect the intended design, and the Verifier can detect conflicts between the intended and as-implemented design. We demonstrate each stage in this process, showing how the Toolkit effectively helps to close the gap between design and implementation, recreate design documentation, and maintaining consistency between intent and execution.'),('10.1186/s40807-018-0051-6','Self-sufficiency of 3-D printers: utilizing stand-alone solar photovoltaic power systems','Khan, Khalid Yousuf','Renewables: Wind, Water, and Solar','AbstractA self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) is a type of 3-D printer capable of printing many of its own components in addition to a wide assortment of products from high-value scientific or medical tools to household products and toys. There is some evidence that these printers could provide low-cost distributed manufacturing in underprivileged rural areas. For the most isolated communities without access to the electric grid, a low-cost alternative energy is needed. Solar energy can be harvested through a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) power system specifically designed to match the needs of the RepRap. The voltage and current requirement for the printer demands the use of buck along with a bidirectional DC converters to ensure proper operation. This paper provides the design for a stand-alone PVâ€”lithium ion battery power system with an efficient controller. Robust and agile PI controller schemes are utilized to efficiently maintain the distribution of energy through the power system. The system was defined with ordinary differential equations, simulated and tested for two operational conditions in MATLAB/Simulink. The results showed that the controller developed operates the system in a stable condition and the simulation shows steady acceptable behavior that makes this system highly suitable for hardware implementation.'),(' 10.1145/2364412.2364465\r\n',' Introduction to software product lines adoption\r\n',' Linda M.

While a clear schedule has yet to be drafted, it is expected that ISS will cease operation in the 2020s. What could be the layout for a human outpost in LEO with lessons learnt from ISS? What are the use cases and applications of such an outpost in the future? The System Analysis Space Segment group of the German Aerospace Center investigated these and other questions and developed the Orbital Hub concept. In this paper an overview is presented of how the overall concept has been derived and its properties and layouts are described. Starting with a workshop involving the science community, the scientific requirements have been derived and Strawman payloads have been defined for use in further design activities. These design activities focused on Concurrent Engineering studies, where besides DLR employees participants from the industry and astronauts were involved. The result is an expandable concept that is composed of two main parts, the Base Platform, home for a permanent crew of up to three astronauts, and the Free Flyer, an uncrewed autonomous research platform. This modular approach provides one major advantage: the decoupling of the habitat and payload leading to increased quality of the micro-gravity environment. The former provides an environment for human physiology experiments, while the latter allows science without the perturbations caused by a crew, e.g. material experiments or Earth observation. The Free Flyer is designed to operate for up to 3Â months on its own, but can dock with the space station for maintenance and experiment servicing. It also has a hybrid propulsion system, chemical and electrical, for different applications. The hubâ€™s design allows launch with just three launches, as the total mass of all the hub parts is about 60,000Â kg. The main focus of the design is on autonomy and reducing crew maintenance and repair efforts, and reducing the need for extravehicular activities. Following a description of the design approach and technical details, cost estimation and a detailed discussion of the use cases for such a station concept, along with the possible scenarios of international cooperation, are also presented in this paper.'),('10.1007/s10845-018-1416-9','Industrial wearable system: the human-centric empowering technology in Industry 4.0','Kong, Xiang T.

There is an increasing awareness that human presence is not only one type of manufacturing capability, but also contributes to the overall systemâ€™s fault tolerant. How to achieve the seamless integration between human and machines/robots and harness humanâ€™s full potential is a critical issue for the success of Industry 4.0. In this research, a human-centric empowering technology: industrial wearable system is proposed. The aim of this system is to establish a humanâ€“cyberâ€“physical symbiosis to support real time, trusting, and dynamic interaction among operators, machines and production systems. In order to design a substantial framework, three world-leading R&D groups in this field are investigated. Five design considerations have been identified from real-life pilot projects. The future trends and research opportunities also show great promise of industrial wearable system in the next generation of manufacturing.'),('10.1186/s13635-018-0072-0','Towards constructive approach to end-to-end slice isolation in 5G networks','Kotulski, Zbigniew','EURASIP Journal on Information Security','AbstractAlthough 5G (fifth generation) networks are still in the realm of ideas, their architecture can be considered as reaching a forming phase. There are several reports and white papers which attempt to precise 5G architectural requirements presenting them from different points of view, including techno-socio-economic impacts and technological constraints. Most of them deal with network slicing aspects as a central point, often strengthening slices with slice isolation. The idea of isolation in the network is not new. However, currently considered technologies give new capabilities that can bring added value in this field. The goal of this paper is to present and examine the isolation capabilities and selected approaches to its realization in network slicing context. As the 5G architecture is still evolving, the specification of isolated slices operation and management brings new requirements that need to be addressed, especially in a context of end-to-end (E2E) security. Thus, an outline of recent trends in slice isolation and a set of challenges are presented. The challenges, if properly addressed, could be a step from the concept of 5G networks to proof-of-concept solutions which provide E2E userâ€™s security based on slices isolation. Among other things, the key features are proper slice design and establishment, security at interfaces, suitable access protocols, correct virtual resources sharing, and an adaptable management and orchestration architecture (MANO). In conclusion of the paper, short outlines of two of the main secure isolation challenges are given: a proper definition of isolation parameters and designing suitable MANO system.'),('10.1007/s12193-018-0258-2','Model-based adaptive user interface based on context and user experience evaluation','Hussain, Jamil','Journal on Multimodal User Interfaces','AbstractPersonalized services have greater impact on user experience to effect the level of user satisfaction. Many approaches provide personalized services in the form of an adaptive user interface. The focus of these approaches is limited to specific domains rather than a generalized approach applicable to every domain. In this paper, we proposed a domain and device-independent model-based adaptive user interfacing methodology. Unlike state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed methodology is dependent on the evaluation of user context and user experience (UX). The proposed methodology is implemented as an adaptive UI/UX authoring (A-UI/UX-A) tool; a system capable of adapting user interface based on the utilization of contextual factors, such as user disabilities, environmental factors (e.g. light level, noise level, and location) and device use, at runtime using the adaptation rules devised for rendering the adapted interface. To validate effectiveness of the proposed A-UI/UX-A tool and methodology, user-centric and statistical evaluation methods are used. The results show that the proposed methodology outperforms the existing approaches in adapting user interfaces by utilizing the users context and experience.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-70019-9_24','A Retrospective on Constructing a Personal Narrative on Agile Development','Morien, Roy','Recent Advances and Future Prospects in Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems','AbstractThe underlying principles of Agile Development had been stated and established for 30 years before the Agile Manifesto was proposed. Software Prototyping, Rapid Application Development, Rapid Development, Iterative Development, even Help Desks and SWAT teams must be seen as antecedents of Agile Development, as we understand it today. The original proponents of â€˜agile developmentâ€™ attempted to develop a new narrative for software system development. However, notwithstanding the length of this history, now some 45 years in the making, many developers, and education institutions, still question the approach, still refuse to include it in course curriculum, at least partly due to it being ignored in IEEE curriculum structures, still demand â€˜proof that it worksâ€™, and still adhere to the traditional linear phased thinking of the Waterfall Approaches. Responding to the need for â€˜proofâ€™ and attempting to debate the adherents of the long-standing Waterfall Approaches has proven futile, but a new narrative has been evolved which attempts to describe Agile Development as being a normal, usual approach to human activity, reflecting the way people inevitably act when intending to undertake, and in the process of undertaking, any purposeful activity with a planned outcome. Uncertainty is the norm, planning is essential but empirical and adaptive, leadership is preferred over management. Other research disciplines have much to contribute to agile thinking and action.\n'),('10.1007/978-3-319-62217-0_70','Agile Fit Check Framework for Government Acquisition Programs','Mobasser, Supannika K.','Disciplinary Convergence in Systems Engineering Research','AbstractTo embrace the rapid rate of change in software system development, it is crucial to be flexible, resilient, and robust. Although there is no one-size-fits-all process, an agile approach has been increasingly popular and widely adopted in the software industry. Aerospace and defense contractors have gradually started to adopt agile principles and its manifesto. However, there are questions on whether agile would be a good fit for large-scale mission-critical programs or better yet how we know whether we should use agile. If so, should we use agile as it is used in commercial software-intensive industry or should we tailor the process so that it is still agile but also compliant with government regulations. This paper discusses a framework that can be used to check the fitness of a proposal for an agile development based on the systemâ€™s characteristics and on both the government and the offerorsâ€™ readiness. This framework does not give a yes/no answer on whether a program should use an agile development process, but assists the program office in the identification and mitigation of the risks of an agile approach for a particular system. This framework will also identify opportunities for process tailoring and improvement. The framework was developed with the proposal phase in mind; however, it can be used at any time during the software development lifecycle to help mitigate agile development risks.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-61161-7_8','Software Defined Virtual Networks','Oppitz, Marcus','Inventing the Cloud Century','AbstractNetwork Virtualization is used for consolidation of infrastructure without compromising access controls protecting sensitive information.Virtualization became the foundation and enabler of many new technology trends like cloud computing, Internet of Things, fog computing and big data and analytics and, hence, is one of the central chapters of this book.

This effort could require, for example, putting the customers at the center of the business with complete control over what is happening around them, integrated logistics for the products that you sell, an obsession with quality, and of course, compelling technology. Still, technology is a true element of a new digital company and, in some cases, it is where the competitiveness and the originality of the products are created. Certainly, technology cannot be effective if it is not fully integrated into all the companyâ€™s processes and its organization. It also requires adequate, flexible, and low cost Information Systems. The understanding of which type of changes should be applied to these factors is therefore a key element of any digital transformation plan in order to fuel a profitable digital business. The organizational matter also crosses another very important aspect: the scouting, farming, and transformation of the competences of the personnel involved in the new digital business. These competences include new technical skills as well as an understanding of what is needed to transform the current information systems so that they can be used to map the journey from where you are today to where you want to be in the future. In this chapter we are going to explore such questions as: 1.What are the trends in new technologies and how are they influencing exponential organizations?2.How are new technologies, like containerization, different data organization, and processing algorithms setting the ground for a new way to manage IT in enterprises?3.Is it possible to build systems with very high quality, zero downtime and a very strong resiliency against negative events?4.How should the approach to software development, testing and management be transformed?5.What architecture should we use to build modular, elastic, adaptive, and much more efficient IT solutions?6.How central is DevOps in the new IT world? Are Cloud and Utility Computing the same thing?7.How are successful companies developing digital IT organizations that can both foster business innovation and assure robust and effective deployment?8.Does one IT in our company still suffice or do we need at least three: transformational, traditional and autonomous?9.How should the IT technical team be re-organized and reskilled to support this new development and support approach?The chapter will introduce the reasons behind these changes and suggestions on what can be done to deal with this complex and articulated transformational challenge.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-91662-0_12','Improving Legacy Applications with Client-Side Augmentations','Rivero, JosÃ© MatÃ­as','Web Engineering','Abstract\nMobile devices have become the most prominent channel to access Web applications.

Uncertainty is a polysemic term (poly â€“ many, sema â€“ a sign). Historically, the first terms related to uncertainty were accident, probability and possibility, which we relate to Aristotle. Up to the twentieth century, the mathematical basics of uncertainty factor description were founded on probabilityâ€“frequency interpretation and are related to Pascal, Ferma, Bernoulli and Laplace. Modern probability theory is based on the research of Kolmogorov, who introduced an axiomatic definition of probability as a measure related to a system of axioms of a so-called probability space.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-57478-3_12','A Knowledge-Based Paradigm of Public Sector Reforms in Asia','Matsunaga, Masaei','Knowledge Creation in Public Administrations','AbstractThe counties of Southeast AsiaSoutheast Asia have reached a critical stage in their socioeconomic development.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-70491-3_1','Digital Transformation of the Consulting Industryâ€”Introduction and Overview','Nissen, Volker','Digital Transformation of the Consulting Industry','AbstractEven though the total turnover in the consulting industry is increasing year after year, the competitive playing field for consultancies is changing rapidly. This is due to recent developments in potentially disruptive technologies used by successful digital newcomers, but also substantial changes and evolving requirements on the client side. In the face of new challenges and changing framework conditions, consultants should continually assess their service portfolio and critically review the traditional personnel-intensive â€˜face-to-faceâ€™ delivery model of consulting. Like many of their clients, consulting firms are facing a digital transformation process that will lead to partially or completely virtualized processes, adapted organization structures and digital business models. Virtualization promises innovative possibilities for optimized performance and service delivery, thereby strengthening the competitive position. A serious analysis with regard to the potentials of virtualization within the different phases of consulting projects, within the consulting organization and in cooperation with customers and partners is necessary. To this end, knowledge should be accumulated at an early stage and a comprehensive vision should be developed that combines traditional and digitalized consulting approaches in a value-adding way. This introductory article reviews and structures the recent technology and market developments, provides examples of virtual consulting services, and outlines how a digital transformation initiative in consulting can be set up.'),('10.1007/978-981-10-6005-2_46','Integrated Next-Generation Network Security Model','Meena, Rajesh Kumar','Next-Generation Networks','AbstractIn todayâ€™s scenario, cyber threats are becoming labyrinth and difficult to manage. The traditional security management systems are not capable to handle upcoming novel threats resulting in performance deterioration. In this paper, various next-generation technologies have been integrated together that provide an efficient, manageable, robust, and flexible system that not only effectively tackles all the existing attacks but can mutate itself to fight against zero-day attacks. The proposed system includes intelligent techniques that are required for the future cyber world like next-generation intrusion prevention system (NGIPS), network breach exposure system (NBES), cloud-based antivirus, anti-spam, personalized censor-ware, SPARTA (access control service), MONICAN (control and management technique). It will result in a reliable, efficient, and quick responsive system to obtain remarkable results in the network security.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-61974-3_7','The Scientific Problems with the Mega Infrastructure Construction Management Theory','Sheng, Zhaohan','Fundamental Theories of Mega Infrastructure Construction Management','AbstractThe general connotation and significance of the scientific problems associated with the theory system have been elaborated in Sect. 4.4. Now, based on the core concepts and rationales discussed in Chaps. 5 and 6, we employ the core concepts and make deductions based on the explicit rationales to identify the academic scientific problems and their theoretical values with respect to the mega infrastructure construction management theory. Although this is only a tentative exploration of the building of scientific problems in the mega infrastructure construction management theory system, its significance is far more important because only after the establishment of the complete logic chain, i.e., core conceptsâ€”rationalesâ€”scientific problems, can the mega infrastructure construction management theory system be perceived as generally normative and complete.'),('10.1007/978-1-4842-3399-3_1','Choosing Lightweight Frameworks for Intuitive Web Design','Shenoy, Aravind','CSS Framework Alternatives','AbstractWhen it comes to web design, Bootstrap, Foundation, and Materialize are probably the first frameworks that come to a designerâ€™s mind, given their massive range of components and attributes. However, when talking about light web projects, you do not usually need a comprehensive framework like Bootstrap or Foundation (again, depending on the complexity of your project). Usually, to build a small web site, lightweight frameworks can do the job effectively and cut down the bulk, or noise, associated with massive frameworks. For example, if your web site merely needs something like a grid or some popular components commonly found in most frameworks, then you should consider a lightweight framework.'),('10.1007/978-981-10-4106-8_14','The Role of Resiliency in Managing Supply Chains Disruptions','Ganguly, Anirban','Supply Chain Risk Management','AbstractCurrent day business organizations, symbolized by complex and global supply chains, are often subjected to unforeseen threats that result in huge financial losses. There are no sure ways of assessing these threats, especially the â€œblack swansâ€ (high-impact, but low-probability events like natural disasters, terrorist attacks, outbreaks, etc.), as the severe dearth of historical data excludes the use of forecasting tools to evaluate those disruptions. However, it has been observed that some organizations cope far better than others in addressing these unforeseen and unquantifiable disruptions. This is not because they have a â€˜secret formulaâ€™, but due to them sharing a critical trait known as resilience. The notion of supply chain resiliency, which is the ability of a supply chain to recover to the â€˜pre-disruptionâ€™ or a better state after suffering through a disruption process, has always been considered as a core element in the success of an organization. The primary objective of this chapter is to familiarize the readers with the concept of supply chain resiliency and its role in mitigating supply chain disruptions. The chapter will also reveal the advantages of a resilient supply chain through insightful examples from a wide range of industries.'),(' 10.1145/3123779.3123789\r\n',' Design principles of an embedded language (EFL) enabling well defined order-independent execution\r\n',' Moshe Goldstein\r\n',' Proceedings of the Fifth European Conference on the Engineering of Computer-Based Systems\r\n',''),(' 10.1145/2940679.2940681\r\n',' Energy supply aware power planning for flexible loads\r\n',' Florian Niedermeier\r\n',' Proceedings of the 5th International Workshop on Energy Efficient Data Centres\r\n',''),(' 10.1145/367845.367941\r\n',' Taking advantage of design patterns in GIS domain (poster session)\r\n',' L.

JPLAS provides the fill-in-blank problem to help novice students studying Java programming at home, where some elements in a high-quality code including reserved words, identifiers, and control symbols are blanked to be filled by students. Unfortunately, this problem may be solved without reading out the algorithm in the code if students are familiar with Java grammar to some extent. In this paper, to further cultivate the code reading capability of students, we propose a concept of the value trace problem to ask the actual values of important variables in a code implementing some fundamental data structure or algorithm. A value trace problem can be generated by: 1) selecting a high-quality class code for the algorithm to be studied, 2) making the main class to instantiate the class in 1) if it does not contain the main method, 3) adding the functions to output variable values in questions into a text file, 4) preparing the input file to the code in 3) if necessary, 5)running this code to obtain the set of variable values in the text file, 6) blanking some values from the text file to be filled by students, and 7) uploading the final code, the blanked text file, and the correct answer file into the JPLAS server, and adding the brief description on the algorithm for a new assignment. To verify the feasibility of this concept, we manually generated five problems and asked four students with high Java programming skills in our group to solve them.

Ross','Electrical Engineers - Part IIIA: Radiocommunication, Journal of the Institution of','The problems of direction-finding at high frequencies may divided for convenience into three groups, (a) those dealing with instrument itself, (b) those dealing with phenomena occurring in course of propagation of the waves, and (c) those concerned with interpretation of the bearings once the readings have been obtained. As to the instrument, the basic type of high-frequency direction-finder during the past decade has been the Adcock, using spaced vertical aerials. During the war years, attempts were made to improve performance of the simple Adcock direction-finder by the use of earth mats or arrangements of radial counterpoise wires. Some reduction of polarization error on sites of low conductivity was thereby achieved. There were advances in bearing display, particularly in regard instantaneous direct-reading types, while improvements in design components such as receivers and goniometers have resulted in all-round improvement in the performance of high-frequency ground station direction-finders. To overcome the difficulties of polarization error inherent in Adcocktype direction-finders, several types of practical spaced-loop directionfinders have been developed in recent years. These are all of the rotating coaxial-aerial type. Future improvements in instrumental design are likely to involve departure from the small-aperture spaced-aerial arrangement, and systems of wide aperture, in which the direction of the wavefront is determined by measurements made at widely separated points are forecast. Reduction of certain types of wave-interference errors, particularly those due to scattering, is likely to be achieved. Recent advances in knowledge of the propagation of waves in the high-frequency band have been concerned chiefly with ionospheric waves. A good deal of information of a statistical nature concerning the deviations suffered by these waves has been accumulated but much still remains to be done, particularly as regards a study of the characteristics and stru- ture of the ionospheric irregularities causing deviations. During the war years various attempts to overcome some the difficulties encountered when dealing with ionospheric waves were made. Of these, the most important were the ray selection technique involving apparatus for the selection of a single ray component of complex signal) and the employment of groups or clusters of directionfinding stations in place of single stations. In the future, the use instruments of large aperture is likely to cause both of these techniques to be outmoded. Once a bearing from a single direction-finding station or a group bearings from a network of direction-finding stations has been obtained, there arises the problem of deciding what information is contained the figures as to the true direction or position of the transmitter. This is the problem of interpretation and it is essentially a statistical one. There are at least two parts to the problem, (a) to determine, a priori, the probable accuracy of the individual bearing or bearings; and (b) with this information to determine the most probable location the transmitter and establish areas within which there is a given probability of finding the transmitter. The first of these two problems is essentially the more difficult, and though there have been attempts at a solution by various schemes for \"classifying\" the bearings according to probable errors there is still no fully satisfactory solution. Given solution of the first, the second problem is mathematically simple, the solution being found in terms of the principle of least squares. In the future, the development of mechanical, electronic or other devices which will carry out the necessary operations automatically is likely to proceed.'),('10.1109/TBME.1970.4502705','Human Factors Underlying the Design of Reading Aids for the Blind','Patrick W.

Nevertheless, despite the fact that many of the fundamental coding problems will be avoided by this procedure, it must be recognized that the sighted reader achieves high reading speeds and good comprehension by means of a complex scanning strategy, and that to realize the fullest advantages of the speech medium, the blind reader will have to be capable of exercising flexible motor control over the output of his reading machine.'),('10.1162/jocn_a_01214','The Neural Basis of Successful Word Reading in Aphasia','Sara B. Pillay','Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience','<para>Understanding the neural basis of recovery from stroke is a major research goal. Many functional neuroimaging studies have identified changes in brain activity in people with aphasia, but it is unclear whether these changes truly support successful performance or merely reflect increased task difficulty. We addressed this problem by examining differences in brain activity associated with correct and incorrect responses on an overt reading task. On the basis of previous proposals that semantic retrieval can assist pronunciation of written words, we hypothesized that recruitment of semantic areas would be greater on successful trials. Participants were 21 patients with left-hemisphere stroke with phonologic retrieval deficits. They read words aloud during an event-related fMRI paradigm. BOLD signals obtained during correct and incorrect trials were contrasted to highlight brain activity specific to successful trials. Successful word reading was associated with higher BOLD signal in the left angular gyrus. In contrast, BOLD signal in bilateral posterior inferior frontal cortex, SMA, and anterior cingulate cortex was greater on incorrect trials. These data show for the first time the brain regions where neural activity is correlated specifically with successful performance in people with aphasia. The angular gyrus is a key node in the semantic network, consistent with the hypothesis that additional recruitment of the semantic system contributes to successful word production when phonologic retrieval is impaired. Higher activity in other brain regions during incorrect trials likely reflects secondary engagement of attention, working memory, and error monitoring processes when phonologic retrieval is unsuccessful.</para>'),('10.1109/JAIEE.1925.6534254','Transmission stability: Analytical discussion of some factors entering into the problem','C. L. Fortescue','Journal of the A.I.E.E.','The subject of stability has been much discussed lately, because it has an important bearing on future large power developments. In the early stages of a large program, such as the proposed superpower program, good engineering and common-sense dictate that each step should be very carefully considered from all points of view, since a blunder or failure to give proper weight to some important factor, such as stability, might set back the development program for many years. A brief historical review of the subject of stability follows; for those who are not familiar with &#x201C;static&#x201D; stability there is a review of the subject in the Appendix. A criterion of stability is suggested based on present operating conditions, namely, that for reliability each unit of the superpower shall be at least equal to the best that has heretofore been obtained with similar power systems. The necessity of a careful study of the characteristics of all machinery connected to the transmission line is pointed out. The necessity of proper inherent characteristics in generators and synchronous condensers is emphasized, and particular stress is laid on the necessity of proper volt ampere characteristics both inherent and with the exciter. The action inside a generator during the transient following a change in load is discussed; it is pointed out that the true field is a resultant due to several magnetomotive forces in addition to that of the field circuit; the combined effect is a marked tendency to self-excitation, and inherent self-excitation would take place if it were not for the damping effect of resistance in the different circuits. A brief review of other factors entering into the problem is given. These factors comprise inertia of moving parts, mechanical torque, speed of relays, circuit breakers, etc. The difficulty of correlating all these quantities is pointed out, and a basis on which it is practical to make computation is suggested. Those who have not studied the sub- ect of stability are recommended to read the Appendix before proceeding with the subject of transient stability. The subject of transient stability is opened with a definition of stability of a power system. The elements of the problem are discussed in some detail. The problem is one of obtaining the conditions of equilibrium, taking into account mechanical or applied torque, electrical or counter torque, inertia torque and damping factors, in addition to the electrical characteristics of the system. The action of a generator under suddenly applied load is discussed in some detail. The &#x201C;transient&#x201D; stability of a simple system is discussed, use being made of a new diagram known as the power angle diagram which may be derived from the circle diagram as obtained for static stability. Three diagrams are required for the simple investigation but the method may be elaborated to include all the factors affecting the problem including the characteristics of governors, exciter systems, and so forth. The difference between the problems of switching operations, load swings and short circuits is pointed out. In the last case the effect of different values of ground resistance is discussed at some length and also the effect of length of time before circuit breaker opens. The necessity of obtaining reliable data on ground resistance with faults is stressed. Throughout this paper the essentiality of delivering the necessary kilovolt-amperes to the line either by adequate exciter systems or by proper modification of machine characteristics in order to maintain a high order of stability is insisted on. It is pointed out in the Appendix that while inherently compensated generator, synchronous condensers, etc., are future possibilities, our main concern is the problem of getting the most out of present day designs as our present day problems depend on these and not on something that may be commercially developed five years from now.

Concentrating on contributions which have not yet been discussed in other chapters, in Sect. 12.6 an overview of argumentation research in the Nordic countries is given, in Sect. 12.7 of argumentation studies in German-speaking areas, and in Sect. 12.8 of argumentation studies in Dutch-speaking areas. The study of argumentation in French-speaking areas is discussed in Sect. 12.9, and the study of argumentation in Italian-speaking areas in Sect. 12.10.The next areas focused on are Eastern Europe, in Sect. 12.11, and Russia and other parts of the former USSR, in Sect. 12.12. Section 12.13 is devoted to the state of the art in argumentation theory in Spanish-speaking areas and Sect. 12.14 to the state of the art in Portuguese-speaking areas. Next, in Sect. 12.15 argumentation research in Israel is discussed, and in Sect. 12.16 argumentation research in the Arab world. The chapter concludes with an overview of the study of argumentation in Japan in Sect. 12.17 and an overview of the study of argumentation in China in Sect. 12.18.'),('10.1007/978-94-007-6165-0_130-2','Reading and Science Learning','Yore, Larry D.','Encyclopedia of Science Education',''),('10.1007/978-3-642-40458-0_16-1','Statistical Inference','Rahlf, Thomas','Handbook of Cliometrics','AbstractStatistical and, subsequently, econometric inferences have not undergone a cumulative, progressive process. We have seen instead the emergence of a number of different views, which have often been confused with each other in textbook literature on the subject. It therefore makes sense to approach the issue from a historical-scientific angle rather than a systematic one. We intend, using the extraordinarily complex development as a basis, to give a historical overview of the emergence of concepts that are of particular importance from the point of view of cliometrics. We shall start by describing the beginnings of modern probability theory, along with its connection with other statistical approaches. The following overview covers the basic principles of the current concepts of inference developed by R. A. Fisher on one hand and by J. Neyman and E. S. Pearson on the other. Neo-Bayesian approaches have meanwhile been developed in parallel, although they were not taken into account during the initial founding phase of econometrics. A â€œclassicâ€ approach was instead adopted in this respect, albeit with an additional difficulty: the taking into account of time. Cliometrics initially followed a Bayesian approach, but this did not finally prevail. Following on from econometrics, a correspondingly classic, inference-based position was adopted. This chapter concludes with a reference to a fundamental critique of the classic position by Rudolf Kalman, which we also find very promising as an inference-related concept for cliometrics. We often quote authors directly, in an effort to portray developments more vividly.'),('10.1007/978-94-007-6883-3_2-1','Classical Backgrounds','Eemeren, Frans H.','Handbook of Argumentation Theory','AbstractThis chapter sketches the origin as well as the further development of the disciplines of dialectic, logic, and rhetoric in antiquity. For the beginnings of dialectic and logic, the chapter turns in Sect. 2.2 to Zenoâ€™s reductio technique and Platoâ€™s three forms of dialectic, for those of rhetoric to the Sophists and the educator Isocrates.The chapter discusses Aristotleâ€™s contributions to all three disciplines mentioned. In Sect. 2.3 Aristotleâ€™s theory of dialectic is discussed. The fundamental features of the ancient discussion procedure are explained, the construction of argumentation by means of topoi (argument schemes), and tactical issues concerning debates. Sect. 2.4 is devoted to Aristotleâ€™s fallacy theory. The theory of topics of Cicero and Boethius is discussed in Sect. 2.5. Sect. 2.6 explains Aristotleâ€™s syllogistic â€“ a precursor of predicate logic. Sect. 2.7 deals with Stoic logic â€“ a precursor of propositional logic.Aristotleâ€™s systematic reflections on rhetoric as the art of finding the appropriate means of persuasion are the topic of attention in Sect. 2.8. Sect. 2.9 deals with the classical system of rhetoric, which developed after Aristotleâ€™s time. The system is illustrated by going systematically through the consecutive tasks a speaker has to accomplish in preparation of the actual performance of a speech. In Sect. 2.10, finally, the ancient achievements are tied in with later developments and shown to relate to the various approaches to argumentation developed in present-day argumentation theory.'),('10.1007/978-94-007-6165-0_179-1','Scientific Literacy: Its Relationship to â€œLiteracyâ€','Norris, Stephen','Encyclopedia of Science Education',''),('10.1007/978-94-007-6994-6_15-1','Design for the Value of Inclusiveness','Keates, Simeon','Handbook of Ethics, Values, and Technological Design','AbstractThere is an increasing awareness that many everyday products and services present challenges and difficulties to potential users. These difficulties may arise because the products and services have not been designed to allow for the full range of functional capabilities of the users who wish to use them. Medical conditions, accidents, ageing, or genetic predisposition means that most people will at some point experience functional impairments that make everyday products and services difficult to use. This chapter aims to introduce readers to the needs of the full range of users and provide an introduction to how they can develop more inclusive products and services.

In Sect. 8.2, the overview of the state of the art starts with a discussion of the role of argumentation in the debate tradition. Although argumentation theory is not yet part of this tradition, all kinds of concepts that were central in the early textbooks still play an important role in argumentation studies in the United States. This justifies paying attention to some of the pre-theoretical notions introduced in these textbooks.In Sect. 8.3, the starting points for theorizing about argumentation are discussed that later on have been developed in communication studies. The literature concerned is characterized by much reflection on the issues considered to be most crucial to dealing with argumentation: What is argumentation? How does argumentation manifest itself? What is the relation of argumentation to logic, dialectic, and rhetoric? The answers to these questions serve in fact as preambles to the theorizing.Sect. 8.4 concentrates on the first of the two branches that traditionally can be distinguished in communication studies: historical-political analysis, also known as rhetorical criticism. Sect. 8.5 provides an overview of the other branch, rhetorical theory, again with an emphasis on argumentation and rhetorical phenomena closely related to argumentation.Sect. 8.6 discusses â€œargument fieldsâ€ and â€œspheres of argumentationâ€ â€“ two important concepts that have been further developed after Toulmin first introduced the notion of argument fields. Sect. 8.7 concentrates on the relatively new research perspective of â€œnormative pragmatics,â€ an approach that examines the norms playing a part in dealing with argumentation in actual argumentative practices. In Sect. 8.8, the role of argumentation in persuasion research is discussed. Finally, in Sect. 8.9, attention is paid to the study of argumentation in interpersonal communication.'),('10.1007/978-3-319-01904-8_3-1','A Framework for the Acceptance of Gerontechnology in Relation to Smart Living','Bouwhuis, Don G.','Handbook of Smart Homes, Health Care and Well-Being','AbstractDespite the wide availability of telecare devices, the economic pressures, and the claimed benefits, the uptake of telecare services by older people is disappointingly limited. Much research is spent on finding out why the telecare acceptance is so much less than expected.Ease of use, or rather lack of it â€“ a seemingly likely cause â€“ is difficult to assess since the traditional usability criteria do not apply well to the daily life of older people. Acceptance in the social environment plays an important role, sometimes in a positive sense, but mostly in a negative one; however, social environment is all but impossible to manipulate.What does delay acceptance is the lack of standardization, which, in turn is also due to the fact that the impressive technological progress of the past decades has largely bypassed the field of assistive technology and health care. Another negative factor is cost. Though the price of devices has come down appreciably in recent years, system architecture and installation are getting more expensive and increased functionality goes hand in hand with higher cost. Next, during the actual running of telecare systems, successful operation has to compete with inherent difficulties of decision making in a noisy context. Making correct diagnoses is necessarily connected with false alarms, which may render the telecare system unusable. This is exacerbated by sources of unreliability in the system as a whole, like falling sensors, disconnected leads, empty batteries, and erased memories.In the light of these difficulties, traditional Technology Acceptance Models (TAMs) are focusing on a very small part and then probably the wrong one of the whole complex multistage decision process in implementing a telecare system.As it is, the comparatively immature state of telecare systems is up to now a multisectoral issue, in which stakeholders of different economic sectors operate mostly independently. Early stakeholders take decisions which later ones have to accept, up to the client as the end user, who also has to accept, but often does not. In a confusing situation like this, where the client is confronted with a system he or she has not chosen, it is doubtful that models based on a theory of rational behavior like the TAMs or Innovation Theory are valid at all.What should be minimally done on the basis of these observations are three things.First, an effective business case should be developed to run a telecare system â€“ currently absent. Second, in addition to regulation, there should be a strong effort in the area of standardization. Finally, telecare should become a product that older people want, not one they have to accept.'),('10.1007/978-94-007-6165-0_304-2','Print Media','Norris, Stephen','Encyclopedia of Science Education',''),('10.1007/978-3-642-36197-5_85-1','Seismic Behavior of Ancient Monuments: From Collapse Observation to Permanent Monitoring','Gattulli, Vincenzo','Encyclopedia of Earthquake Engineering',''),('10.1007/978-3-642-41554-8_71-1','Measurements and Assessments on Field Plots','KÃ¶hl, Michael','Tropical Forestry Handbook','AbstractField assessments and remote sensing imagery are the most essential data sources in forest inventories.

Subsequently, we explore the methodological challenges and problems that this brings to the table. First, we show that contemporary design methods are aimed at realizing values of users and society. These values are in general not moral ones yet do include in specific cases moral values. Second, we introduce a division between user-driven methods in which it are the users who introduce the values to be designed for and designer-driven methods in which the clients and designers are introducing these values. Third, we discuss two designer-driven design methods in detail for, respectively, design in general and social design in particular: the Vision in Product design method and the Social Implication Design method. Finally, we explore the challenges and problems of design for moral values with these and other design methods. We focus specifically on the designer who, once design is recognized as design for moral values, becomes responsible for the moral values the resulting products have.

Toulmin presents in his model of argumentation a novel approach to analyzing the way in which claims can be justified in response to challenges. The model replaces the old concepts of â€œpremiseâ€ and â€œconclusionâ€ with the new concepts of â€œclaim,â€ â€œdata,â€ â€œwarrant,â€ â€œmodal qualifier,â€ â€œrebuttal,â€ and â€œbacking.â€ Because of the impact Toulminâ€™s ideas about logic and everyday reasoning have had, he can be regarded as one of the founding fathers of modern argumentation theory.In Sect. 4.2, the study The Uses of Argument, in which Toulmin expounded his views and explained his model, is introduced. Sect. 4.3 concentrates on the geometrical model of validity that is, according to Toulmin, at the heart of the misunderstandings about formal logic he wants to terminate. The distinction he makes in this endeavor between analytic and substantial arguments is treated in Sect. 4.4. In Sect. 4.5, the difference between field-invariant and field-dependent aspects of argumentative discourse is explained, which is vital to the alternative to the formal approach to analytic arguments offered by Toulmin. In Sect. 4.6 the forms arguments take and their validity are discussed, which leads to the presentation of Toulminâ€™s new model of argumentation in Sect. 4.7. Sect. 4.8 focuses on appropriations of the Toulmin model by argumentation theorists from different backgrounds. Sect. 4.9 discusses various applications of the model. In Sect. 4.10, the chapter is concluded with a critical appreciation of Toulminâ€™s contribution to argumentation theory.'),('10.1007/978-1-4614-8968-9_26-1','Evaluating Damage with Digital Image Correlation: C. Applications to Composite Materials','Hild, FranÃ§ois','Handbook of Damage Mechanics','AbstractThe present chapter is devoted to the evaluation of damage with digital image correlation (DIC). Applications will focus on composite materials. The latter ones are designed to accommodate microcracks through suited microstructures. As such, they constitute a natural class of materials for which damage (or rather damages) is an essential feature of their mechanical behavior. As discussed in a previous chapter (addressing detection of physical damage), DIC can reveal the elementary mechanisms (e.g., dense distribution of microcracks, crack branching along weak interfaces, progressive debonding of interfaces, and subsequent pullout or delamination). It will also be shown that damage laws can be identified with the help of DIC from mechanical tests imaged at different stages of loading. The followed strategy will be seen as reminiscent of the one that was used in the previous chapter dedicated to 1D (i.e., beam like) geometries (from physical to mechanical damage). Here, it will be necessary to couple DIC with finite element models. The benefit will be that in addition to the identified law, a full validation is naturally offered from the highly redundant piece of information contained in the measured displacement fields.'),('10.1007/978-3-642-40458-0_14-1','Financial Markets and Cliometrics','Neal, Larry','Handbook of Cliometrics','AbstractThe study of financial markets is a growing part of cliometrics for at least three reasons. First, appreciation of the role financial markets played in the rise and spread of capitalism has grown, along with concerns about financial crises. Second, accessibility to the immense amount of data generated by financial markets keeps improving thanks to continued advances in digital communications technology. Third, analytical techniques for determining the behavioral patterns of time series have advanced. While typically only price data for financial assets are available without the corresponding volume of the assets being traded, the consequences of sharp, or sustained, changes in the price of financial assets can be detected in other economic data. Interesting insights on fundamental historical issues are also possible by applying economic and political theory to cliometric studies of financial markets.'),('10.1007/978-94-007-6994-6_22-1','Design for Values in Architecture','Schrijver, Lara','Handbook of Ethics, Values, and Technological Design','AbstractThe notion of design for values, or value-sensitive design, is founded on the idea that design principles are related to ethical, moral, social, and political values. In architecture, a general relation between values and design is present throughout the history of the discipline. However, the question then arises which values are related to design principles and how. This chapter examines architecture as a general application domain in which values have been of central concern throughout its history. It departs from the supposition that values are by necessity part of the project of architecture and unravel aspects of these values. These aspects include the distinction between implicit and explicit values, the unexpected effects of design intentions, the distinction between general values and their particular (historical) readings, and perhaps most importantly the life-span of buildings, which often outlasts the value systems they arose from.'),(' 10.1145/1291233.1291420\r\n',' Floor-plan reconstruction from panoramic images\r\n',' Dirk Farin\r\n',' Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Multimedia\r\n',''),(' 10.1145/2063576.2063639\r\n',' Personalizing web search results by reading level\r\n',' Kevyn Collins-Thompson\r\n',' Proceedings of the 20th ACM international conference on Information and knowledge management\r\n',''),(' 10.1145/1291233.1291306\r\n',' A real-time augmented-reality system for sports broadcast video enhancement\r\n',' Jungong Han\r\n',' Proceedings of the 15th ACM international conference on Multimedia\r\n',''),(' 10.1145/1124706.1121459\r\n',' Turning automata theory into a hands-on course\r\n',' Susan H.
